=============================================================================================

v1.0.9 (August 5th, 2013):
  * Fixed serious bug in the save/load state form. Setting weren't being loaded properly and 
    by consequence they were being saved with the wrong values
  * Added the ability to launch a game through HyperLaunch from within the module settings form
  * Added support for the new admissible values for the ini key Restore_Front_End_On_Exit, it's 
    not a boolean any longer

v1.0.8 (July 30th, 2013):
  * Added ability to export have/missing lists from both audit panel. Supports both Text and 
    HTML output formats
  * Added support for HyperLaunch's new Player 2 navigation keys
  * Added support to change system names directly from within HLHQ. This will also rename all 
    the necessary files and folders. It won't rename any emulator or roms paths though you'll 
    have to do that manually if you also want to change them. I ended up adding this because 
    the plugin system now allows me this flexibility while keeping HLHQ frontend independent
  * When browsing File and Folder settings in the module settings form the browse starting path 
    will now default to the current value if there's one
  * Easier filling of the FadeTitle for PCLauncher, now it's as easy as launching the game and 
    pressing Ctrl+q to get that info filled in. Uses code from djvj's ActiveWindowsLogger to 
    grab the window information
  * Moved the checkbox "Only show modules/emulators that are appropriate for the current system" 
    from the Emulators tab into the HyperLaunchHQ tab. This means this setting is now also saved 
    into HyperLaunchHQ.ini
  * Added support for 2 new HyperPause ini keys : Bar_Vertical_Offset and Full_Screen_Help_Text_Timer
  * Split General Settings\HyperLaunch tab into 2 moving all controls keys in it's own tab

v1.0.7 (July 23rd, 2013):
  * Fixed 3DArcade plugin to properly handle rom names with dots in their filenames
  * Added code to handle errors while accessing the clipboard in some machines, only a warning 
    will be written to the log file now
  * Excluded system and hidden folders from the audit caching system, audit could potentially 
    fail if the system trying to look into a protected folder
  * Replaced FolderBrowserDialog by a customized version of it to allow manual path entering

v1.0.6 (July 17th, 2013):
  * Copy log contents to clipboard directly from HLHQ
  * Changed again the layout in the module settings editor, added a GridSplitter this time 
    hopefully it will solve all situations
  * Corrected bug in audit where rom extensions were case sensitive
  * Added support to copy the selected log line in the log viewer screen using Ctrl+C
  * Fixed bug in the audit system where the game list would become empty under certain conditions
  * Added support for 2 new ini keys : Logging_Show_Command_Window and Logging_Log_Command_Window
  * Added the port number each controller is connected to under the xpadder tab in the keymapper
    screen

v1.0.5 (July 12th, 2013):
  * Added Full System Audit feature. It's now possible to audit the roms several or all of your 
    systems at once
  * Corrected bug with GridSplitter in the keymappers panel where it wasn't resizing properly
  * Corrected bug and added some extra validations to the plugin loading mechanism
  * Added option to enable/disable loading plugins
  * Added ScrollViewer on module settings editor form in order to support lower resolution 
    monitors

v1.0.4 (July 6th, 2013):

  * Added the ability to launch your frontend from HLHQ (From General Settings tab)
  * System Notes feature - You can now add your own personal text notes for any system you 
    want (Settings tab)
  * Added new option Rom Extension to Skip Checks setting
  * Database Plugin System added. You can create your own plugins to make HLHQ read your 
    databases from any format, making it possible to use HLHQ with any frontend

v1.0.3 (July 3rd, 2013):

  * Added support for the 7z_Sounds ini key
  * Changed module parser to support the new MSystem tag declaration

  * Other minor bug fixes

v1.0.2 (June 28th, 2013):

  * Fixed crash when reseting General Settings to the default values
  * Added a feature to check if HyperLaunch is running and the ability to stop it from the 
    HyperLaunchHQ panel
  * Corrected bug with absolute/relative paths in the module settings editor

Description=4 in 1 Row is a translation of the Connect Four board game. Two players (Pussycat and Hounddog) take turns dropping colored (red or green) discs in an eight-column six-row grid. The object is to place 4 discs in a row, either vertically, horizontally or diagonally.<br><br>An strategic indicator number on the right side of the screen, besides each name, will show the chances of each player to get four discs in a row. The higher the number, the higher the chances. If the number reads 125 it means the player is just one move away from winning. The strategic indicator can be turned off by pressing CLEAR.<br><br>When playing against the computer, two variations with three skill levels are available:<br>Playing against Microcat I, II or III (selected by pressing 1, 2 or 3). Microcat uses a micro-sensor (represented by a µ sign) which will stop over each column calculating its chances. The disc will be dropped where the µ stops. The higher the skill level, the bigger the sensor and calculation times.<br><br>Playing against Microdog I, II or III (selected by pressing 5, 6 or 7) is similar to playing against Microcat (with the skill levels and µ sensor), but the player can also ask for computer assistance on moves. Whenever player's Pussycat appears, pressing 1, 2 or 3, depending on the skill level, will make the PRESS ENTER text appear along the micro sensor. Once pressed, the computer will take over and will continue until the player presses again 0 and ENTER when Pussycat appears.

Description=Air Battle is a flight simulator set in the World War I era. The player controls a biplane from an inside-the-cockpit perspective.<br><br>The player starts the game with the plane on ground. The plane will start moving and a flashing light will indicate when the plane has achieved enough speed to take-off. Once in the air, the player must try to take down the most enemy planes possible, while avoiding hitting friendly planes. The enemy planes have white tail sections while friendly have yellow tail sections. There's no way of telling if a plane is friend or foe if it is coming straight at the player, until it starts firing. The player can see incoming planes through a radar in the middle of the panel.<br><br>The player gains points for hitting or taking down enemy planes, but will also be penalized by hitting or taking down friendly planes. There are four levels of difficulty, starting at zero points, 200 points, 500 points and 1000 points. The levels can also be selected directly from the game start, by pressing "0", "1", "2" or "3" to start.<br><br>There's a fuel meter at the left of the panel and a ammunition meter at the right. When any of these are close to end, the player has to land the plane and refuel/recharge his plane. The game ends if the player is shot down by enemy planes or if the plane crashes while taking-off, landing or due to lack of fuel.

Only when it is red it can do harm to the mobile laser unit, if they are of any other color, they will only stick to the mobile laser unit until it moves and releases itself from the Blobber. As the time passes, an adult Blobber will multiply, releasing a new small yellow spot which will eventually grow into another adult Blobber. When Blobbers are hit, they are reduced to the immediate previous stage of development (from red to white, then purple, then yellow, then deceased).<br><br>In the middle of the screen, moving blocks called Magic Transporters move up and down randomly.

The Blobbers will also be transported by them. Also, they are impenetrable by the laser gun, meaning the player will only be able to hit one Blobber when there are no Magic Transporters in the laser's way.<br><br>The Blobbers will become faster every 90 seconds until finally reaching the mobile laser unit's speed.

Description=Q*bert is a conversion of the popular arcade game. The goal is to change all of the tiles on a pyramid to the target color. To do this you guide Q*bert around the pyramid, and every tile he hops on will change color. On early levels, a single hop will change the tile to the desired color, but on later levels you may need to hop on a tile multiple times or even avoid hopping on a tile multiple times! Trying to stop Q*bert are many different creatures which wander around the board, including Coily the snake, Slick and Sam, and falling balls. On the edge of the board are floating discs; if Q*bert jumps on one of these discs when the snake is in pursuit, the snake will fall off  the board while Q*bert is safely transported to the top.

Description=Sid the Spellbinder was one of the three games specifically designed to use the resources of The Voice. It is some sort of Space Invaders variation, in which instead of shooting space invaders, the player has to shoot Sid the Spellbinder, a giant segmented snake. Sid comes snaking down the screen and the player has to shoot its segments before it reaches the openings at the lower sides of the screen. The player starts with 30 missiles (20 in skill level 2) and scores in an arithmetic progression: one point for the first segment, two for the second, three for the third and so on, up to 10. If the player's score is below 200, Sid will align its remaining segments together whenever it goes off the screen. If the player's score is 200 or more, the gaps will remain making it harder to the player to shoot Sid. If Sid gets into those openings, it will eat the missiles in the reserve. Sid eats five missiles for each of its segments left when it enters the opening.<br><br>If the player hits all of Sid's segments, or if Sid gets to the lower end of the screen and leaves the player with some missiles after eating, the game changes into a spelling game. The computer will speak a word and the player has to type it in. Each round has 3 words to be spelled and the player has two chances to spell each word. The player earns 10 missiles (5 in skill level 2) for each word spelled correctly. The game is over when all missiles are gone.

Opening a box makes a little house show up, and you must go with the kidturtle to the house before you can release the next one. All the while, you must avoid the bugs/cars running around the maze. If they get too close, you can release a mine which will stun them temporarily. When you run out of mines, you must resupply by passing over a star in the centre of the screen. Beware, though, because the simpleminded bugs become smarter as time passes; this is symbolised by their changing colours. On later levels, those sneaky beetles can also come out of the boxes supposed to hold kidturtles.

Description=While the packaging promises "an electronic simulation so real you can even spike a shot", this is in fact a volleyball game (the first for a home console) which has a very loose interpretation of the standard rules. In fact, it can be described as a cross between volleyball and Pong: Each six-man team is separated by a large line, which the casual observer would interpret as the net. The line is open at the top, and this is the only place where the ball can pass through into the other court. While the ball is in your court, it can be passed as many times you want, and bounced against the "net" and the back of the court. As long as the ball doesn't touch the bottom of the screen, it is safe. The joystick moves the entire team in strict formation, and the ball passes through the players if they are held still, or bounced in the direction they are moving. A status display at the bottom of the screen writes out in clear text whether there is a serve change, a spike, scoring or otherwise.

By pressing the action button, the general will ask the robots to follow his lead.<br><br>There are trees spread though the battlefield. Robots can't move through trees, but generals can, though they'll move slower when doing so.

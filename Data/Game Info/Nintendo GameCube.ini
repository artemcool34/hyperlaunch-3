Description=Animal Crossing, dubbed a "communication game" by Nintendo, is an updated version of Animal Forest + on the Nintendo 64.<br><br>In Animal Crossing, you arrive at a new town (named by you).  You play as one character (who you also name) throughout the game.  For an example, I named my character James, after me, and the town Toronto, after the city I grew up in.<br><br>Animal Crossing has no set goal; instead, it's more of a Sims type game, in which you can do what you want, when you want, without rules, goals or time limit.<br><br>When you first arrive, you will be given a house to live in.  Unfortunately, you have no money, so the owner decides to make you work at his store.  You can perform various tasks, such as planting flowers and trees around the store, in which you get paid in "bells", the game's form of currency.  There are also other ways to make money; you can perform various tasks for the other citizens of the town, you can fish and then sell your caught fish, you can collect items and sell them, or you can just "find" money.<br><br>The most unique feature of Animal Crossing is it's use of the GameCube's internal clock.  The game will run according to what your clock is set at.  If your GameCube clock says it's 2:45 in the afternoon on October 1st, the game will take place at that time.  If you don't play the game until October 5th, the game will pick up on October 5th.  The game also uses the clock to serve a night/day cycle, a seasons cycle, and a festivities cycle.  When your clock reads December 15th, the game will show snow on the ground and snow falling.  When the clock reads December 25th, you will see various Christmas activities, such as Santa suits.  The same applies to Halloween, Valentine's Day, etc.  The game also has a night/day cycle, meaning if you play the game at 4:00pm, it'll be bright, and if you play at 11:00pm, it'll be dark.<br><br>Another unique feature is the game's item system.  If you wish to give an item to a friend over the Internet, you go to the store (in the game, that is), choose the item, enter your friend's name and town (exactly), and you will receive a code.  You then give this code to your friend, who will type it into the game, and then receive the item.<br><br>Another feature of the game is its compatibility with the GameBoy Advance.  You can use the GBA to go to an entirely new "island" where you can create patterns that are found in the game, then transferred to your save game.  AC is also compatible with the E-Reader, an electronic card swiper which allows you to play old NES games, such as Donkey Kong.<br><br>Among the other features of the game is it's message system, it's letter writing system, and the interaction between you and the various inhabitants.

When a battle begins your deck of cards will be randomly dealt to you; battles are turn based, on each turn you can select cards from those visible to use. Different cards also feature different attributes, and various combos are possible. When a battle is won, your characters will earn experience points, gold, and will also recover all hit points.<br><br>The battles in the game aren't random; as you explore the worlds, enemies will be visible on screen in some areas and contact with them begins the battle.

You will encounter many types of enemies on both the main quest and subquests; since different enemies may require different strategies, you have the ability to customize the deck of cards you will use in battle. As you gain experience, you will also gain the ability to create multiple decks.

Description=Racing a car is one thing, but racing into traffic at high speeds, where you are rewarded for the style of your crash, is another. This is the idea behind Burnout 2, which brings new modes and higher speeds compared to the original title. As usual, the aim is to speed around real life roadways, through the traffic ahead, while keeping all 4 wheels on the ground. <br><br>Burnout is a street racing game focused around speed and crashing.  Unlike many games which focus on closed course driving, you get to drive through cities with real traffic and city infrastructure.  Designers have built an entire city and surrounding areas, and implement the race courses throughput the countie's streets.  As a result, many times certain parts of race-courses interlace with other parts of other races.  As well, instead of encouraging strategic driving and safe driving, Burnout strongly encourages offensive driving.  Driving on the wrong side of the road, barely missing passing traffic, drifting, and jumps all add to your boost "burnout" meter.  Speed boosts and jumps aid your attempt to dive past buses, trucks and anything else that gets in the way.  The more offensive and dangerous your driving is, the more boost you get!<br><br>Burnout 2 contains a full campaign and custom car campaign.  While you can unlock regular cars and tracks, later in the campaign you unlock more raceways like reverse tracks and one-way sprints.  You can unlock over 20 cars like a Nascar, a 1920's gangster car, a Japanese muscle, and many customized vehicles with custom paint jobs and upgraded stats.  <br><br>Along with the same sense of speed and highly detailed crash animations as before, Point of Impact packages new modes of play.  Pursuit mode has you playing the cop as you chase down the speeding motorists, and to win you must crash them out of the race.  Or you can reverse that with a friend.  You can flee from a friend while he attempts to chase you.  Crash mode, as the name suggests, forces you to glide into crowded intersections to get the most cars involved in a pile-up as possible.  The bigger the crash, the better.  Up to 4 players can compete for the best score.<br><br>Training and 2 player racing modes are also included.

Description=Crazy Taxi is an arcade-like racer where the player takes the role of a taxi driver who weaves his way through crowded streets, across sidewalks and even under water, in a wild and frantic race to deliver passengers on time. The courses are largely set inside cities crowded with general traffic and pedestrians (which can't be run over, they dive away). The main goal is to bring as many customers as possible to their destination in time. Available customers are marked through circles and the colour represents the distance and the fare they offer. Green means long rides with plenty of money, and red ones are very short. <br><br>In the main Arcade mode there is a timer that quickly runs down. It can be replenished by picking up customers. While driving reckless maneuvers are encouraged. Players can disregard all traffic rules and customers give extra tips for speedy and dangerous driving, but these can only be cashed when the customer arrives at his destination in time. By the same token the reward at the end of a ride is based on the amount of time left, as each customer also has a personal timer. The city is filled with slopes and jumps, and the game uses a very loose driving model. No damage can be done to the car, so driving as fast as possible is encouraged. While driving players can toy with the gears to perform two special tricks: a crazy drift and a crazy boost to speed up more quickly.<br><br>Next to the Arcade mode there is an Original mode, and Crazy Box where specific goals need to be met on closed down courses. In the regular modes it is possible to disregard the usual timer and play for a fixed amount of minutes. At the end of the race the player is rewarded with a license, either D, C, B or A, with S for an outstanding performance. Next to the interactive courses from the arcade version there is a new course for home consoles. There are four cabs and drivers to choose from. The cars have different statistics and the drivers different attitudes while racing. The game has a soundtrack featuring The Offspring and Bad Religion (not for the Xbox 360 version).

There are mission objectives, but usually the only way to achieve them leads through the enemies and just as usually the only way to fail them is to be overwhelmed by the Bad Guys. Beating up enemies yields points, which can be used to upgrade characters with new special moves or unlock various bonus materials.<br><br>To spice it all up, developer Seven Studios have also thrown in a co-op mode that allows for playing the normal single-player mission in a tag team with a second player.

Also new is the concept of "Team Chemistry"  which affects how well a team plays collectively. <br><br>Featuring 26 leagues from 19 countries, 29 real stadiums and over 10'000 players with data for the 2005-06 seasons, as well as international teams, the game kept the "Create a player" feature as well as the many managing options untouched from previous versions. Career mode, the 15-year long climb to the top of the game, features new options such as sponsorships (which will only accept good results), player contracts and more weight on the player morale: a demoralized player (usually from not playing or possible influence from random events) is more likely to under-perform as well as pressuring the "Team Chemistry" values downwards and might refuse attempts to renew his contract, leaving on a free transfer.<br><br>While there are still many unlockables in the game (mostly third kits), the way to earn points changed. Instead of gaining points from completing tasks (from entering the EA Trax or creating a player to winning the Champions League or completing a career), the player has over 100 scenarios to way in five difficulty levels.

Spain, England (with two), France, Germany and Italy also feature second divisions. Players can also create two clubs, customizing their badge, kits and home stadium, selecting players from anywhere in the game, along the starting budget in manager mode. The player creation tool remains mostly unchanged, with the ability to customize everything, from faces  (with a complete set of options, from jaw width to eyebrow shape) to the appearance and playing abilities.<br><br>While the focus of this yearly update was on the game engine, the Manager mode was also enhanced: players now also improve their playing ability from being active members of the squad, forcing the player to choose between keeping his celebrated stars near retirement in the starting eleven, or give the benefits of the youth system a chance to shine. Another new feature, in what is now the primary mode of the series, is the ability to watch the game in a simplified text mode, with the ability to jump into action to turn the events still available. The points system was replaced by a less abstract currency model (with the ability to choose between Pounds, Euros or Dollars). Other game modes include Tournaments (including the creation of custom tournaments) and Challenges. By completing challenges (similar to the Global Challenges mode in World Cup 2006) the player can spend points in the Fanshop with items such as new teams, a special overhead camera, new balls from Adidas (including all original World Cup balls from 1974 to 2002), stadiums, third kits and special celebrations for created players.<br><br>Finally, online gaming received a new mode: Interactive Leagues. These are online-only leagues based on the fixtures of their real counterparts (English Premier League, French Ligue 1, German Bundesliga and Mexican 1st division). Then, online players go head -to-head with their favorite teams with a victory counting one vote for their favorite team. Once the week is over, the team with more votes is declared the winner of the week, getting three points. The number of weekly matches a player can do in this mode is unlimited.

The plot of this first Final Fantasy game for a Nintendo console since Final Fantasy VI goes back to the roots of the series, but the gameplay has changed a lot. Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles is an action,  Zelda-style RPG. At the beginning of the game, the player chooses one of the four available character classes: magic-using Yulks, thief-like Selkies, gentle-natured Clavattes, and cute little Lilties. The game can be played with the chosen character in single-player mode, or, using the GBA-GC connection link, played with three other people, each controlling their own character.<br><br>Each character has both armor and a weapon that can be replaced by crafting a new one with the appropriate items in towns. Found in each monster-filled area are artifacts that raise statistic points until the end of the area, and upon completion one artifact can be kept to raise that stat permanently. In a multiplayer game players will be given secret objectives, and by completing their objective they have a chance at claiming first dibs on artifacts at the end of the area. Spells are also found in combat areas, though they can not be taken out of them. If spells are placed next to each other in the quick select list, or cast near each other in a multiplayer game, they will merge and become a more powerful spell. Finally in single player mode a moggle will take care of holding the "bucket" that pushes away the toxic miasma around the party, but in a multiplayer game one of the players will have to take up this ignoble task.

As with all the Gauntlet games, you play a medieval fantasy character who, along with allies if you have them, fights his or her way through hordes of evil creatures on the never ending quest for more gold and perhaps even an eventual goal. <br><br>This version contains the characters and levels from Gauntlet: Legends, plus the new characters and levels from the Dark Legacy arcade game, with a few extra levels thrown in.<br><br>There are eight characters to initially choose from: the mighty Warrior, the deadly Valkyrie, the quick-footed Archer, the powerful Wizard, the spellcasting Sorceress, the stalwart Knight, the valiant Dwarf, and the chaotic Jester. Although there are similarities between characters from the two games, each character looks and plays differently. In addition, there are eight alternative-modes for these characters to unlock, plus dozens of secret characters to obtain. With a multi-tap, up to four players can play, with rules governing how much they can hurt each other. Unlike the original Gauntlets, the levels you'll face take place in various terrain from forests to mountains to volcanic plains. Many of the monsters are familiar to old fans of the series, but there are some new blood among the ranks of evil, including some rather large foes. <br><br>Unlike the early Gauntlet arcade games, the camera angle varies from location to location, from bird's eye to nearly ground level. The lands, creatures, and heroes are all rendered in 3D. While the graphics have been upgraded, the game play is very similar. You basically run around levels, hacking at what seems like unlimited armies of monsters, searching for gold, keys, and health-giving food...as well as a way out of the level. Bosses and other scripted events slow down the repetitious nature of the originals.<br><br>While levels can be gained and characters saved, Gauntlet: Dark Legacy is an action game with some RPG trappings and should not be confused with the more true types from that genre.

Description=Two years after versions on other platforms, the then-current consoles got their own adaptation of the first Harry Potter book and film. Like in the computer and PlayStation versions, Harry Potter's first year at school of magic Hogwarts is presented as a 3D action adventure title.<br><br>After a tutorial at Ollivander's Wand Shop and an introductory first night at Hogwarts, the game is organized into distinct days and nights. Days mostly consist of lessons, where usually Harry will learn new spells. The more interesting stuff happens at night, of course, when Harry sneaks around the castle to do things like meeting Draco Malfoy for a duel, fighting a troll in the dungeons, and other important scenes from the film and book.<br><br>Most tasks involve platform sections, where Harry has to jump over chasms and balance along edges. Often, creatures will be in the way that have to be fought using the correct spells, and magic must also be used to solve the occasional puzzle. At night, Harry must watch out for prefects patrolling the floors of the castle to avoid getting sent back to the common room. There's also broomstick flying in the game, including a Quidditch match against Slytherin.<br><br>After classes, Hogwarts can be freely explored. At any time, it is possible to revisit school lessons to get better grades, often only possible after some more advanced spells have been learned. Also, lots of collectibles can be found both in the open and hidden areas: collecting 20 wizard cards increases Harry's health and Every Flavour Beans can be traded in Fred and George's shop for more cards and some other useful items.

Description=Quidditch, the broomstick and ball sport of the Harry Potter world comes to life in this simulation.  For those unfamiliar with the game, two seven player teams of flying wizards attempt to score goals with one ball while dodging more flying balls and each other.  For those who are familiar with the game, you will be happy to know that the players, positions, and strategies of Quidditch are faithfully recreated.<br><br>The game starts with a player selecting which of the four Hogwarts school teams he or she wishes to play for.  Following some tutorial events, they are launched into the competition for the Hogwarts Cup against the other three teams.  As the player wins games and completes specific challenges (such as score 120 points in one game) they collect Quidditch cards which unlock special combo moves.  Once a player has won the school championship, they can go on to play as one of nine international teams competing for the Quidditch World Cup each with its own style and special combo moves.  After winning the cup once, there are still more cards to be collected by playing and winning as different teams.<br><br>People familiar with actual sports know that the rules of Quidditch (as described in Rowlings' books) are fundamentally flawed and that the only meaningful part of the game is the 1 on 1 competition between the two seekers trying to catch the golden snitch.  Quidditch World Cup alleviates this problem with the golden snitch bar.  As the game progresses, completing action combos and performing special moves adds to a team progress bar.  Eventually, when the snitch appears, the team with better positioning on the bar will start with an advantage in the chase.  Ironically, this system rewards things other than actual scoring so in-game goals still remain mostly meaningless (except on lower difficulty levels where it is very easy to build a 160+ point lead and make the snitch inconsequential).<br><br>Because it is designed for younger audiences, Quidditch World Cup lacks most of the advanced features you would expect in an EA sports game (league play, team management, etc).  It also lacks any multiplayer options other than two player (same machine) exhibition matches

But he is tricked into returning to his trade when his friend, a priest, gets kidnapped by an Italian mafioso. <br>Hitman 2: Silent Assassin is a third-person stealth game. As a titular hitman, you have to complete a number of missions all over the world. Each mission generally involves assassinating someone, and possibly fulfilling a couple of other objectives. <br><br>Typically, your target will be protected by numerous guards. While there's a large arsenal of weapons available to you - ranging from stealthy weapons such as a garrote or a silenced pistol, up to machine guns and sniper rifles - your main weapon will be stealth. Agent 47 can sneak around to remain undetected, and he can disguise himself in clothes from killed or stunned guards. <br><br>The guards aren't completely stupid, however, as they will investigate suspicious noises, and they'll react if they see you waving around a gun. They'll get suspicious if they see you running around, raise alarm upon finding a corpse, and if you hang in a disguise around them too long, they'll eventually realize you're not one of their buddies. <br><br>Hitman 2: Silent Assassin brings something new to the series: depending on your stealthiness, you are given a rating upon completing a mission. Going trigger-happy on everyone will result in being called a "Mass Murderer", while only the most patient and skilled players will manage to receive the "Silent Assassin" rating, which generally involves stealthily eliminating the target without raising any suspicion.

Eventually an adventurer appeared who was able to defeat Vaati. This adventurer carried with him the four sword which caused him to be split into four beings, and by working together the four beings were able to seal Vaati deep within the earth. But now Vaati has escaped, and the task of defeating him again has fallen to Link!<br><br>This action adventure game is played from a top down point of view. There are a variety of often maze-like lands to explore (some above ground and others below) as well as a variety of enemies to defeat. Since Link is now in possession of the four sword, there are four Links on the screen. In order to complete the various stages, the four Links will often need to work together in order to solve puzzles and defeat the many enemies. The four links are able to form several different formations, such as a line or square. The formations help the Links perform actions that couldn't be done by one, like moving heavy objects or defeating numerous enemies. At the beginning of each stage, the four sword will be weak in power; to replenish the swords power, force gems must be collected (which can be found hidden in various locations or by defeating enemies). At the end of each stage is a dark magic barrier, and the only way to destroy it is by a four sword which has been completely restored. The game can be played by one to four players, however there will always be four links on the screen.

Description=Twilight Princess is the first Legend of Zelda game for the Wii and also the last for GameCube. At first Link is a simple farm boy, whose tasks consist of herding goats to watching children in Ordon village, Link's home town. One day, Link is asked by the mayor to run an errand in Castle Town, but things sudden go wrong<br><br>The land becomes dark, and strange creatures appear from another world called the Twilight Realm, which turns most into ghosts. Link, however, becomes a wolf. After becoming a wolf, Link is aided by Midna, a resident of the Twilight Realm. Midna helps Link find a way to turn human again along with other tasks.<br><br>The wolf cannot use a sword or other items. Instead, Link must use his senses to solve puzzles and get past obstacles. The beast can also dig holes to find hearts and rupees and to get in places. He can push blocks with his head to climb higher or reveal hidden passageways. Additionally, he can attack enemies by biting or pouncing on them.<br><br>As a human, Link can move around quickly, aim his bow, swing his sword, and even fish. Link also collects many different items, which allow him to perform varied attacks and reach places he couldn't before. Link performs many attacks with his sword and can even learn other sword moves.<br><br>The art is similar to the naturalistic style of Ocarina of Time, rather than the cel-shaded look of The Wind Waker. Chronologically, the game takes place between the two aforementioned titles and quite a few locations from Ocarina of Time can be visited. The main adventure takes place in several provinces with dungeons and temples. With the help of Midna, you can easily travel around quickly later in the game.

Description=The Twin Snakes is a remake of the 1998 Playstation tactical espionage action game Metal Gear Solid.<br><br>You assume the role of a former member of a special military organization FOXHOUND, going by the codename Solid Snake. After the events described in the two Metal Gear games, Snake decided to retire and to live in solitude in Alaska. However, the US government needs him once again. A terrorist organization led by former FOXHOUND members threatens to fire a nuclear bomb if the government does not hand to them the remains of Big Boss, the "legendary soldier" who was once their commander. Solid Snake is sent to infiltrate the terrorists' base, to rescue the scientists kept there, and to find a way to destroy the unknown nuclear weapon. There is another consideration that makes Solid Snake interested in the case: the leader of the terrorists bears the codename Liquid Snake and looks very similar to the special agent...<br><br>The Twin Snakes has the same story and dialogues as the original (although voice-overs were re-recorded for this release). The locations in the game also remained the same, but the graphics were updated to look equal in quality to contemporary games. Gameplay was also enhanced, featuring the additions that first appeared in Metal Gear Solid 2. Snake can now roll, hang from ledges, hide in lockers, drag guards' bodies away, as well as aim and shoot from first-person view. New weapons from Metal Gear Solid 2 (such as tranquilizer gun) are also present. Another noticeable change is in the game's cut scenes. Directed by the Japanese action movie director Ryuhei Kitamura, the cut scenes have a certain Matrix feel, featuring slow motion and other effects.

Description=Long ago, a bird-like race of creatures (called the Chozo) became extremely advanced technologically, but due to increasing violence in the universe, they began to hide and live more simple lives. The planet Tallon IV was the site of one of their colonies. Years later, a meteor crashed on Tallon IV releasing the strange element Phazon into the planet. Phazon poisoned anything it came in contact with, causing the plant and animal life to either die or mutate into a hideous form.<br><br>The Chozo tried to control the power of Phazon but failed. Before abandoning the planet, they were able to cover the impact crater with a temple and seal Phazon into the planets core. Now space pirates have discovered Tallon IV, moving in to study Phazon and harnessing its power. They have also began rebuilding their fortress on planet Zebes and reviving the Mother Brain, Ridley, and Kraid, all of whom were destroyed by Samus Aran. However, Samus has tracked the space pirates to Tallon IV and must now enter the planet to destroy them once and for all before they have a chance to rebuild their destructive forces...<br><br>Metroid Prime is a change from the platform-adventuring series, entering the first-person shooter genre for the first time. Players are now behind Samus Aran's visor and must use all their resources to investigate the pirate infestation of Tallon IV. Players can use Samus's beam, with missile and charge capabilities. Along the way, they must recover the bounty hunter's lost abilities like the morph ball and grapple beam, which allow them to reach unexplored areas of Tallon IV.  Players must piece together the story of the fallen Chozo to figure what has happened to the poisoned planet, and prevent the pirates from using the Phazon to wreak havoc throughout the planets.

Description=A long time ago a race of beings called the Luminoth settled the planet Aether. They built energy controllers to harness the "light of Aether" to prolong the life of their planet and its inhabitants. After many ages of peace and prosperity, a meteor collided with the planet; this collision opened a dimensional rift into another world, called Dark Aether. From this world came an evil race of beings known as the Ing, and for many ages a war was fought between the Ing of the dark world and the Luminoth of the light world. Over time the Ing began winning, turning the light world to dark. At about this time, a federation spacecraft happens to be chasing a Space Pirate vessel, which is destroyed by the Ing, through the area. Wondering about the fate of this craft, the Galactic Federation sends an urgent message to Samus Aran, asking her to find the crew and investigate the planet Aether.<br><br>This is the sequel to Metroid Prime where players once again control bounty hunter Samus Aran as she arrives on Aether. The game is played from both a first-person view(walking, running, jumping) and third-person view (morph ball mode and cut scenes). The game uses a combination of action, adventure, and platform game elements; while searching the player is able to uncover the story by finding federation reports and Luminoth lore. There are variety of puzzles to solve to reach new locations, different landscapes that the player can jump and grapple across and attack plenty of enemies. As usual, players begin the game with limited capabilities but additional weapons and suit upgrades can be found, including some standards from the Metroid series such as the varia suit, morph ball bombs, and missiles along with a few new weapons, such as the dark suit, dark beam, and light beam.<br><br>Metroid Prime 2: Echoes also features multiplayer modes for up to four players. In deathmatch, combatants need to hunt down each of the other players. This variation can be played either with a time limit or where the greatest number of frags wins. The second option is called bounty mode; in this variation each player starts with a number of bounty coins. When one player hits another player with a powerful attack, some of their coins will drop, which can be collected. Coins may also be found throughout the landscape, and the player with the most coins at the end wins.

However, Drill Land has five different attractions, each with its own unique take on the Mr. Driller formula:<br><br>1. The Hole of Druaga - An obvious homage to the Namco game The Tower of Druaga, The Hole of Druaga has Anna Hottenmeyer digging through a block filled castle, encountering enemies such as slimes, knights and wizards.  Anna must find and defeat the dragon that is guarding the key to the exit, and then make it to the exit to battle the final boss.<br><br>2. World Drill Tour - The standard Mr. Driller mode of play.  Dig your way through to the set depth, using any character that you like.  Each character has their own strengths and weaknesses.<br><br>3. Star Driller - A spaced themed stage where you play as Susumu.  Dig through the blocks, and make your way to the set depth.  Star blocks are power-ups that can either help (such as a barrier for an extra hit) or hinder (like a black hole that sucks all the blocks away close to you).<br><br>4. Drindy Adventure - This stage stars Taizo from the original Dig Dug, in an Indiana Jones-like setting.  Taizo does not require air in this mode, and his goal is to collect a set amount of gold statues.  In his way are traps like rolling boulders, spikes, and flames.<br><br>5. Horror Night House - A ghost-themed stage featuring Ataru as a ghost hunter.  Your goal is to kill ghosts by first collecting holy water to fill your syringe-like drill, and then wait for ghosts to get close to you, and inject the nearby bricks with holy water to stun them.  While the ghosts are stunned, you can break the bricks to finish them off.<br><br>Mr. Driller: Drill Land also features two multiplayer modes: Race and Battle.  Race has each player trying to be the first to reach the set depth.  Battle has everyone on the same screen, attempting to collect the gold coin.  It takes three gold coins to win.

The career mode offers complete freedom in a city with a story mode supported by FMV cutscenes, as featured in Need for Speed: Most Wanted, but now also set in the Carbon Canyon, where racers duel for territory in the city below. There still are many police pursuits. At the same time, the focus on tuning and sculpting your car remains, as introduced in Need for Speed Underground. As you win money from races, you can visit garages and car lots to make improvements to your vehicle.<br><br>Enhancements are still unlocked gradually, but the cars have now been divided over different tiers. There are about 40 cars to unlock. Many of them have been featured in previous installments, but there is a new selection and this year's edition introduces powerful muscle cars such as the Ford Mustang and Dodge Charger. Other features include the possibility to form your own crew, more detailed sculpting features, drifting races (introduced in NFS:U and replaced by drag races in NFS:MW) and the new car classes. The PC, PS3 and Xbox 360 versions offer online multiplayer, missing from the PS2, GC and Xbox releases. Up to eight players can race together, in the Pursuit Tag or Pursuit Knockout modes, with a few variations. Pursuit Tag is a race of one civilian car against cop cars. To become the civilian car, you have to tag it and then try to fend off the cops as long as possible until you are tagged again by other players. In Pursuit Knockout everyone starts as a civilian car, but the last one at the end of the first lap becomes a cop and needs to cause as much damage as possible to the other speeders. Another mode allows you to drive cooperatively (up to four players) in a single race.<br><br>The city and the surroundings in the career mode have been divided into different territories, controlled by gangs. You are either invited or challenged to race in the sections and claim them as your own. To do so, you have to impress the gang leader by winning races until he challenges you for a duel - first in the city, then over the narrow roads of Carbon Canyon. Scores are based on proximity. You need to follow the boss in the first race, and he is in pursuit in the second one. There are 4 boss duels in total.<br><br>The crew feature, with room for up to 6 cars, allows you to assign three roles to racers: drafters, scouts and blockers. These are supporting characters you can hire to help you win races. Drafters leave behind a coloured trail that makes it easier to find the way, scouts discover hidden shortcuts, and blockers try to cause mayhem to slow your opponents down. If you hire a scout, you get access to the new AutoSculpt feature. It enables you to modify the height of every part of your car through sliders, solely for visual effect. You can also buy full body kits.

Description=Odama is a quirky pinball title set in ancient Japan.  You are in control of a giant steel ball, called the Odama, which you use to crush the enemy army (and hopefully not your own soldiers) so that you have an easier time leading the Ninten Bell to its destination.<br><br>The game also takes of advantage of the GCN microphone (included with most versions of the game), which you use to command your troops. You must use the commands and pinball skills to successfully lead the Ninten Bell to its destination before sunset in each mission.<br><br>Using the L+R buttons to control the flippers, the X button to activate the microphone, and the control stick to tilt the battlefield, the controls in Odama are quite simple for today's standards.  In each mission, you, representing the Yamanouchi clan, try to bring the clan's powerful treasure, the Ninten Bell, as well as the Odama, closer to the Karasuma Keep, headed by the man who betrayed the founder of the Yamanouchi clan.  It is there you will exact revenge for his betrayal.  Notably, the game features a narrator that talks about the story in Japanese, but there are English subtitles.<br><br>The basic goal of each mission is to guide the bell from the bottom to the top of the screen, mowing down the members of the opposing army with the Odama, as well as killing them with your own soldiers.  It is important that they are killed because, if they reach your side of the screen, they will make the flippers inactive for a relatively long period of time.  When all Odamas are lost or the sun sets, you fail the mission.  In addition, you learn commands for your soldiers as you progress through the game.  Using these commands, you'll be able to more effectively control your soldiers in many ways.  For example, by saying, "press forward," your troops will use all of their strength to try and plow through enemy soldiers.  These commands are not only very useful, but in many cases, are vital to your success.<br><br>However, use of certain commands and reckless use of the Odama drains your Morale Bar.  When this bar is low, your troops will stop responding to your commands, which can and will be disastrous to your mission.<br><br>There are also items that the Odama can pick up along the way to aid you.  Most notably is one that allows the Odama to convert all members of the opposing army over to yours when it rolls them over.<br><br>In merging all of these elements, Odama is a very fast, difficult, and frenzied title. Although it is a pinball game at its core, the voice commands, power-ups, and storyline throw it into a league of its own.

Each character is voiced by the original actors from the movie. This is a single player adventure game with action elements.<br><br>In the Hundred-Acre-Wood, Pooh, Eeyore, Roo, Owl, Rabbit and Tigger are going about their normal activities when Piglet sees a scary Granosorus, which disappears before anyone else can see it. When Piglet tries to warn his friends, they don't believe him. Christopher Robin tells Piglet to overcome his fears, but Piglet thinks that he will never be big and brave enough. As his friends start to fall asleep, Piglet leaves the woods and finds a magical telescope which allows him to jump into the dreams his friends are having during their naps.<br><br>In each of the 6 dream "levels", Piglet must help his friends with problems and puzzles. For example, help Pooh find honey or Tigger find his stripes. Each dreamworld is also dangerous with menacing Heffalumps and Woozles, among other scary monsters. Piglet must defeat these monsters with a tactic he knows well - making scary faces. Some monsters aren't frightened enough, though, so use cookies (hidden in the scenery) to buy some scarier ones at the Brave Face Factory. Find and use Christopher Robin's balloon which gives Piglet a morale boost and a burst of speed. Depending upon the scenario, three characters can be controlled: Piglet, Tigger and Winnie the Pooh.<br><br>After the 6 nightmare levels are solved, Piglet will face the real Granosorus from the beginning of the game and become a hero by rescuing his friends.

Description=So Evil they even gave it a subtitle!<br><br>The final installment of the Resident Evil series for the Playstation, Resident Evil 3 takes place during the events of Resident Evil 2. The midwestern town of Raccoon City is in ruins, having been overrun with the undead creating T-virus thanks to the wacky hijinks of William Birkin and Umbrella Inc. As Jill "master of unlocking" Valentine (one of the two main protagonists of the original Resident Evil), you must find a way out of the zombie-infested remains of the city alive. Along the way, you'll interact with and receive help from three heavily armed Umbrella mercenaries who have also become stranded in Raccoon City thanks to the incompetence of their employer. Standing in the way of your group's last escape are a horde of flesh-eating zombified citizens, homicidal mutants, and a relentless killing machine known only as Nemesis who is determined to hunt down and kill the survivors of the original Resident Evil, including Jill.<br><br>A dramatic improvement over Tyrant/Mr. X/G from the previous games, Nemesis possesses the same maneuverability as Jill allowing him to run (faster than you, in fact), use firearms (such as a rocket launcher), dodge attacks, and even move through doors and from room to room in pursuit of Jill. On top of that he still possesses the nigh indestructibility we've come to know and... well, know from Umbrella's ultimate bio-weapons. <br><br>Like its two predecessors Resident Evil 3 is a third-person action-adventure game with polygonal characters on pre-rendered backgrounds with cinematic camera angles, a technique originally pioneered by Alone in the Dark. Although the game uses the same basic engine and gameplay as the previous games, improvements include auto-targeting, a 180 degree spin, and a new dodge move that allows you to avoid enemy attacks by pressing a button a second before they strike. Another addition is Jill's ability to create different kinds of ammunition by mixing together three different types of gunpowder found throughout the game. Compared to Resident Evil 2, the amount of available ammunition and healing items has been significantly decreased, making the game more difficult. The variety of zombie citizens has also been made more diverse.<br><br>The number of polygons in the character models has also been increased, along with the possible screen resolution and color depth for the PC version (up to 1600 X 1200 at 32 bits, from a maximum of 640 X 480 at 16 bits for Resident Evil 2). Another welcome addition in the PC version is the ability to skip cutscenes as well as the door loading animation.<br><br>The PC and Dreamcast versions includes all eight of Jill's possible costumes, as well as the mercenary mini-game Operation Mad Jackal which allows you to play as one of the three Umbrella soldiers. On the Playstation version, these special features must be unlocked by beating the game with a high score.

Kennedy to Europe on a top secret mission to investigate the disappearance of the president's daughter Ashley.

Old friends...and enemies...lurk around every corner as Leon attempts to find out who is truly behind the kidnapping of the president's daughter.<br><br>Resident Evil 4 is a major change from the previous installments.

It features a brand new AI system and more open environments that allow enemies to work together to capture and corner Leon. Enemies are now humans, which allows them to climb up ladders, open doors, and use weapons throughout the game. <br><br>The entire item system has also been revamped, so that smaller items no longer require an entire item space to hold. Instead, items take up blocks of space in a briefcase according to their real life size, to allow for many more items and weapons. Leon can collect treasure from enemies or from the surrounding area, and visit the infamous "merchant" to purchase bigger briefcases, treasure maps, weapons upgrades, and powerful weapons such as the one-shot RPG.<br><br>The game also includes a mode called Separate Ways (which is not included on the original GameCube release and was added to later platforms only) similar to Resident Evil 2's game A/B system, where the player must play the game through the eyes of Ada Wong.

Description=Robocop places you in the titanium-coated-with-kevlar boots of Alex Murphy, killed in the line of duty and resurrected as the cyborg officer Robocop. The 2003 game features a new plot not featured in any of the films. Crime is up in Neo-Detroit due to the rapid proliferation of a new designer drug "Brain Drain," and the efforts of crime lord William Nexx to control its profitable distribution. Meanwhile, a mayoral race is heating up and getting dirty. And of course, mega-corporation OCP's role in all this is almost certain, but unclear. <br><br>Robocop will have to get to the bottom of all of these mysteries through 9 missions. Gameplay is handled as a typical first-person-shooter, with various Robocop enhancements. His HUD is projected on screen and points out available targets. The player can mark up to three targets with a lock-on button, who Robo will then auto-aim at in sequence. Thermal vision can be activated to see through walls in a limited distance. Multiple weapons are also available, from the signature automatic pistol, to missile launchers and energy weapons.<br><br>Objectives are given for each mission, from rescuing hostages to finding clues. Clues can be examined after each mission to explore the story (also updated through TV news breaks, in the style of the films). If the player can target and shoot a enemy's pistol, they will surrender and can be arrested. Should the player kill a hostage or surrendered enemy, they will take damage, forcing the player to follow Robocop's ethics and "prime directives."

Jibolba is along for the ride, but has transformed into a flea for easy transport.

Description=Tales of Symphonia is an RPG that starts off from the peaceful village of Iselia. Where Lloyd Irving is a student under the tutelage of Professor Raine Sage, who specializes in magic and archaeology. His school friend Colette Brunel has been rumored to be the daughter of an angel. She was born with a sacred stone in her hand, because of this she is the "Chosen of Sylvarant". The Chosen must complete the world regeneration, a quest to unlock magic seals and enter the otherworldly Tower of Salvation, to make the slowly dying world a true paradise. This will mean the end of the Desians, a race of half elves, who now dominate the land through work camps, fear, and force. <br><br>The characters develop not only through cut-scenes, many of which feature voice acting, but through what the game calls skits. These  "skits" however, do not feature voice acting like the in-game cut-scenes. A warning is displayed on the bottom left hand side of the screen when a skit becomes available, it can then be activated by pressing Z. The Skit generally features two or more of the characters interacting. They will react to what is said and depending on the characters and the situation the results can be anywhere from comic to tragic. This system really allows one to understand the feelings each character.<br><br>Special features of the game includes: Ex-Spheres, Strategy and Cooking. Ex-Spheres are special objects which enhances a character's abilities or may even grant new ones. These abilities can affect battle or have an effect outside of battle. Each Ex-Sphere will have a level of 1-4 each with more powerful abilities, up to four Ex-Spheres can be attached to any 1 character. Strategy can be applied to CPU controlled players, for example making spell-casters attack a specific enemy or ordering them to stay behind the front-lines. An alternate way to heal characters is to cook. This is based on the specific character's skill to cook and the ingredients used.<br><br>Most of the game is spent, like most RPGs, in towns, dungeons, towers, sprawling world maps, and of course combat. Battles in Tales of Symphonia is fought in real-time. Only four members of your party can participate, each with very unique fighting styles. As the game progresses, you are not restricted to only using Lloyd, all major characters are playable which allows you to switch your gaming style. Basic physical attacks are carried out with the A button and pushing the control stick in various directions. The B button is used for special physical attacks and casting spells. Often these special attacks can be linked from a basic physical attack to Special Attacks in progressing levels of 1-3. During a battle you run in a straight line and are able to jump over enemies. In Multiplayer up to 3 more players may partake in battles with you.

Using the paradoxes of time travel to his advantage, the hero can regularly join up with past and future versions of himself, to fight the enemy as a team. A wide selection of historical, modern, and futuristic weapons is available, and environments feature destructible elements.<br><br>Depending on the difficulty level chosen, players will find themselves with rudimentary objectives to complete or, on the harder settings, new areas and substantially more involved objectives to fulfill. Two players can also play the Story mode cooperatively and simultaneously.<br><br>Like its predecessor, TimeSplitters 2 features a Challenge mode, which presents the player with a selection of time- and skill-based events. Completing these within the predetermined constraints awards the player with bronze, silver, or gold medals, which in turn aid in unlocking additional game options, levels, and playable characters (of which there are more than 120).<br><br>The Arcade mode offers League, Custom, and Network sub-modes. League events feature pre-configured maps, game types, and objectives for the player to compete in, while the other Arcade modes make up the bulk of the multiplayer portion of the title. In the Custom mode, up to four players and numerous AI "bots" can compete in 16 different customizable disciplines including Deathmatch, Regeneration, Virus, Thief, Shrink, Monkey Assistant, and Flame Tag -- each offering an altered form of gameplay. Thief, for example, tasks players with collecting tokens left behind by fallen combatants. Here, the tokens determine the winner, not the number of kills.

Description=Cowabunga!  Take control of your favourite turtle ninjas as you play through the events of the 2007 CGI movie.  Leonardo returns from his meditation in South America to find his family in disarray, and crime on the rise in New York.  A mysterious figure calling himself the "Nightwatcher" has turned up, and a shadowy rich man named Winters seems to be in cahoots with the remnants of the Foot Clan.  Only the Ninja Turtles can clean up the streets!<br><br>TMNT is an action game, similar to Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time.  Play as Leonardo, Michelangelo, Raphael and Donatello, swapping on the fly and using special co-operative moves to help your brothers in battle.  Each turtle, being a ninja, can perform moves like double jumping, running along and up walls, gripping onto tiny cracks in the walls, and jumping from wall to wall to scale dizzying heights.  Most of the game is spent making your way to the next destination by using your ninja moves to explore New York.  Each character also has their own special move: Leo can traverse through walls, Raph can use his Sais to scale particular surfaces, Mikey can use his Nunchucks as helicopters to float for a short period, and Don can pole vault across long gaps with his Bo Staff.<br><br>Sometimes, battles will occur - in these situations, you'll be locked in an arena and must battle all your enemies before you can move on.  Battling is a simple affair - you can use one button for standard attacks (charge it for a more powerful one), and another button for light attacks that push enemies away.  If your fellow turtles are with you, you can also hold down your character swap button for a tandem co-op attack.  Some levels will allow you to play as the Nightwatcher - he fights similarly to the Turtles, except that as the more he fights, the more his 'rage' builds, which can cause a devastating surrounding attack when fully charged.  The Wii version of the game controls similarly to all other versions, except that gestures are used for attacking instead of button presses.<br><br>The basic goal for each level is to get to the end.  At the end of each level, you're graded on the following attributes: your speed, your combat, and the amount of coins collected.  In levels where you work with your brothers, you'll also be graded on how well you worked together.  Succeed in a these attributes, and you'll earn turtle coins which can be used to purchase unlockables.  If you get an A Rank or higher in a level, you'll also unlock a Challenge Map, which can be played to earn even more turtle coins.  Finally, once you've played any level at least once, turtle coins will appear in hard-to-reach spots for you to collect.

Throughout this time, Japan uncovers more and more information that the infamous Black Gold Day was caused by intentional information warfare attacks. As the U.S. prepares to launch the USS Clarence E. Walsh, Third Echelon sends the famous Sam Fisher on a mission that appears to be unrelated to the incident, but which may end up being the most important element of it all.<br><br>In Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory, players take on the role of field operative Sam Fisher for a third outing.

The spy cannot kill with weapons, but he can stun the mercs for several seconds in order to sneak up and kill from behind.<br><br>On the other side, the mercs must make their way to each canister, guarding it from the Shadownet team.  Whenever an alarm is tripped, the merc is instantly alerted to where the spy is.  To help fight the Shadownets, the mercs have a built-in motion sensor view, which picks up any moving objects, as well as an electromagnetic view, which picks up on spy gadgets.  The mercs come equipped with a rifle, and must defend the viral canisters at all costs.<br><br>Multiplayer comes with a good variety of maps, ranging from a warehouse and a factory to a cinema and three towering skyscrapers.  More maps will be available in the future via Xbox Live.

Goals are similar to the previous games, such as collect SKATE, get a certain amount of points, transfer over this and grind that.  There are new goals, however, such as collecting the word COMBO while doing one big combo.  Miss a trick, and goal fails.  Once all regular goals are accomplished, you can attempt the Pro Goal, which is specific to each skater, and is extremely hard.<br><br>All the major skaters are here, including Tony Hawk, Bob Burnquist, Steve Caballero, Kareem Campbell, Rune Gilfberg, Eric Koston, Bucky Lasek, Bam Margera, Rodney Mullen, Chad Muska, Andrew Reynolds, Geoff Rowley, Elissa Steamer and Jamie Thomas.<br><br>The levels are been expanded and are huge.

Description=After many years under Eidos/Silicon Dreams ownership and development, EA releases the official Champions League game for the 2004/2005 season. <br><br>The last rehash of the engine debuted on FIFA 2003, it draws most of it's gameplay elements from the 2005 edition, but with some changes to gameplay such as a slightly more aggressive AI on attack (reducing the need to constantly push players forward using the Off The Ball controls, still present), new refereeing aspects such as some deliberate errors (as in occasional bad offside calls or throw-ins, not cheating the player through mistakes),  advantage rule and handballs and a new set piece system, which replaces the much criticized "targeting" and "push and shove" featured in 2005. This system is much less rigid and less formulaic, as a directional arrow and powerbars define how balls are crossed and there are four player movement setups, thus making each corner and indirect free kicks different. For direct free kicks, players have the option to take driven or curved shots or drop a pass to a nearby player to explore a gap in the defense. All options are available at all times, instead of being determined by the distance to goal. <br>Many of these changes were later adapted into the new FIFA 06 engine, and it was also chosen as the match engine for subsequent Bright Future's  FIFA Manager. <br><br>The presentation takes notes from real television broadcasts, with goals, fouls and attempts on goal being recapped not only in the full-time highlight reel but also during game stoppages and PiP popups. As the game is presented in a faux letterboxed format, next to the scoreline some statistics occasionally popup, allowing to keep track of them for some missions. A very requested feature, the ability to see the energy bars of the closest players to the ball of both teams, was finally included, as well as icons for the special abilities (speed, shooting, dribbling or tackling) of the best players.<br><br>The Champions League, where the player leads one team to the Final in the Atatürk Olympic Stadium in Istanbul, in the quest to succeed FC Porto as European Champions, is one of the available modes, but not the most important. That honour goes to the "The Season" mode, where the player starts by creating his managing avatar, and then proceeds to a a series of 50 missions, with the first being a close last-week match against a Champions League spot rival, proceeding with a buyout of the club and increased expectations, and (hopefully) closing with the Champions League final.  This mode also allows players to unlock additional features such as balls, a stadium and special exhibition modes by fulfilling objectives set by the club president during the season, some of them crucial matches (which can result in a sacking if  failed), others simply a matter of balancing the squad. Other modes include the usual friendlies, "home and away" (a two-legged friendly), scenarios (where the player can create situations such as a defending a 1-0 nil for 45 minutes while two man down) and practice.

Regarding playable fighters, this game combines 20 characters from both the oldest and newer seasons of the series, among them: Kid Muscle, Terry Kenyon, Wally Tusket, Checkmate, Dik Dik Van Dik, Kevin Mask, Jeager, King Muscle, Sunshine, Ramenman, Buffaloman, Terryman, Brocken Jr, etc; plus 10 more, who are &quot;guests&quot; unrelated to the anime series. Other notable aspect of the game is the power-ups: items thrown by your team partner or the manager himself, that among many things can increase your energy or special bars, but also injure your opponents.

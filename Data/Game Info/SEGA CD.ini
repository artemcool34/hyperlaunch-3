Now, the leader of the restored City in the Sea, Scharnhorst, is using old technology and disrupting the balance again. The Girth chose you, Jack Tenrec, and your partner Hannah Dundee, to rid the world of Scharnhorst. And you get to do it in a red '53 Cadillac with mounted machine guns.<br><br>While you're at the task, you must battle hungry, mean dinosaurs, but also be careful not to upset the balance of nature.

The televisual presentation, one of the unique points of the early EA Sports titles, with hosts introducing the matches, was another thing making the game stand out from a market dominated by Sensible Soccer and Kick Off games.<br><br>Based on international teams (with fictional player names), their abilities in each skill area rated out of 10 to give the player an overall impression of how good they are. The options available follow the standard set: fouls and offsides can be toggled on and off, the match length can be set, and if the timer operates  continuously, or only while the ball is in play. Gameplay privileges quick runs, short passes and blistering shots outside the penalty box, and set pieces are controlled by moving a box into the target area for the ball, and then passed, lobbed or kicked directly. On the tactical side, formations can be selected, with 5 different strategies also available (although not all of these combinations make sense) as can the team Coverage - the areas which defenders, midfielders and strikers cover.

Those they abduct return as Pod People-like drones, normal in appearance until they reveal themselves. The government's response is you - a technician driving custom-built gun cameras mounted around the town. Similar to Night Trap or Double Switch, you must monitor the town for alien activity, and respond to protect the lives of the citizens and your agents.<br><br>The game is played entirely through four camera feeds from locations around the town. They mostly show loops of banal activity, but indicators will alert you when important action is occurring at that location. Switching to that camera will allow you to watch crucial plot clips, or defend that camera from aliens in a single-screen shooting gallery. As cameras take more damage, the picture from that feed degrades until the camera itself is destroyed.<br><br>The goal is pretty much to juggle between cameras so as not to miss an important plot point, while defending them from attackers or saving citizens from being abducted. In a neat twist, citizens who you failed to save may appear later as disguised aliens themselves.<br><br>As the game progresses, the invasion increases and becomes more violent, but the basic concept of switching between cameras and engaging in video shooting galleries remains unchanged.

Background music is selected through a dashboard CD player, which also features some rather uninspiring radio stations.<br><br>The game can also be played in a two-player split-screen mode and features a track editor for when you tire of the built-in courses.

Description=The Lawnmower Man is the game based on the 1992 movie of the same name (itself loosely based on a Stephen King short story)  starring pre-Bond fame Pierce Brosnan as Dr. Lawrence Angelo, a scientist working for Virtual Space Industries in "Project 5", a secret research that attempts to increase the intelligence of primates using psychotropic drugs and VR training. <br><br>With his reluctance to aim the research to military purpose, after one of the chimps escapes and shoots a guard in the process he is given a forced vacation, and while taking notes on the need for experiment with a human subject, he notices Jobe Smith (Jeff Fahey), a simpleton who makes his living on odd jobs such as mowing the grass (hence, the title role). The first experiments quickly increase Jobe's intelligence, and while after an accident Angelo stopped the experiments, The Shop, a secret agency overviewing Project 5, reinserted the drugs responsible for violent behaviour into the program and sped up the treatment. As Jobe starts to develop telekinetic powers, he starts to take revenge on those who abused him before he started the treatments, and plots to take over all computers in the world.<br><br>While the CD version of the game (PC, Mega CD) is an interactive movie, both cartridge versions are platformers, the player taking control of Dr. Angelo or Carla Parkette (mother of Jobe's best friend) in typical side-scrolling shooting action. The player can collect better weapons or data discs, which after collecting a number of them allow to morph into the Virtual Suit, which gives protection against a first hit. The player visits several locations seen in the movie, such as the gas pump and the VSI headquarters. <br><br>The twists of the game are true-3D level connectors, based on the CG sequences of the movie, usually all involving avoiding obstacles (and the occasional shooting) at high speed in the VR world. There are four different (Virtual World, Cyber War, Cyber Run and Cyber Tube), each taking a slightly different approach (Virtual World is seen in first person, the objective being dodging obstacles such as trees and archs and reach the exit, Cyber War similar to Virtual World but with some shooting stops, Cyber Run is seen in third person and requires occasional shooting of obstacles, while Cyber Tube is a fast travel with plenty of enemies in a VR tunnel).

The goal of the game is to eventually reach the brain to stop Grey M, the entity that controls Korsby's body.<br><br>Microcosm makes heavy use of full-motion video and features high-resolution fractal graphics (to simulate the walls of veins and arteries), digital music and sound effects.

Terrorists have kidnapped a German biochemist and taken him to a Middle Eastern oil refinery, where he is forced to work on a lethal toxin. Joker and crew must fly to the refinery, shooting down enemy tanks and helicopters, then Joker must rappel down to the refinery and rescue the chemist on foot.<br><br>The helicopter sections follow a pattern similar to Tomcat Alley, showing brief clips of the cast in the cockpit, followed by a "nose camera" shot of an enemy approaching. During this shot, you have the ability to move a set of crosshairs over the enemy and press the "fire" button. If you're on target, you are rewarded with military archival footage of helicopters shooting rockets, and close up footage of models exploding. <br><br>The on-foot sections follow an identical pattern, though with hand-held cameras placing you in the "eyes" of Joker, and black-clad guards taking the place of helicopters. Otherwise, the idea of having a few seconds to react and aim crosshairs is the same. The plot is expanded through occasional cutscenes in both the helicopter and foot sections.

Game modes include exhibition games (or "regular season" in-game), playoffs (best of one or best of seven) and an all new shoot-out mode.

(off, on, on but no offsides). <br><br>While there are some minor differences between platforms (Genesis  features record keeping for users and the MegaCD version has more stat screens, CD quality audio backdrops and the usual highlight clips here and there), only the PC version released at the same time features complete season action.

Description=Based on the novel series by Ryo Mizuno, this version of Record of Lodoss War has the same premise and main characters as the  TurboGrafx CD version, but it is a completely different game. Like the earlier TurboGrafx CD version, it focuses on the adventures of the novel cycle's main hero Parn, his best friend Etoh, and the lovely high elf shaman Deedlit, but concrete events and locations are entirely different.<br><br>Instead of the more traditional Japanese RPG-style world map top-down navigation and random battles, this version has a linear world map and pre-set battles. The strategic element of the battles is stronger, since the battle screens are larger and it is not possible to set battles on auto. Each attack is shown graphically on a separate screen. Hostile areas have standard top-down navigation, while towns are viewed from first-person perspective, and the navigation in them is menu-based.<br><br>The game has voice acting and real anime movie sequences instead of the usual 2D cut-scenes characteristic for anime-style Sega CD games.

Description=Revengers of Vengeance is a combination RPG/vertical shooter/fighting game with a fantasy/anime style. There are ten available characters, each with their own animated backstory and fighting techniques. You must choose a hero and guide their stats to create a formidable fighter capable of taking down the Devil King and freeing the land.<br><br>In the Quest mode, you name your selected character and start at a lowly Level 1. The local town acts as a hub with opportunities for training, equipment purchases and rest. You can leave town and battle contenders for money in the fighting game. You can advance the story by taking quests from the town's guild, which are played in the vertical shooter game.<br><br>The fighting engine is further explored in two side modes - Tournament and Arena of Death. Tournament acts as a basic fighting game, allowing 1 or 2 players to progress through the ranks with the stock characters. No customization is available in this mode.<br><br>Arena of Death allows eight players to be created using the stock character templates. You assign attributes by shifting various bars between two extremes. You can then match these creations against each other and watch as the computer simulates a battle between them. The primary use of this mode appears to be testing various tactics against each other to decide how best to play your character.

Description=This is a remake of the original Road Rash from the early nineties. For those who have not played the original, you are competing against thirteen other "Road Rashers" who will stop at nothing to win 1st, 2nd, or 3rd place. During the race, you have two options available to you: you can either do your best to cross the finish line, or use your weapon to bring the Rashers to the ground if they are giving you trouble. If you do the latter, your opponents will do the same to you during the next race that takes place. <br><br>There are five circuits to race: The City, The Peninsula, Pacific Highway, Sierra Nevada, and Napa Valley. Some of these circuits are dangerous. As well as the obstacles and traffic that you encounter along the way, there are also cops driving on bikes who will arrest you if you happen to crash or stop your bike near them, and you have to pay a fine in order to get in any more races. Your bike will be wrecked if you crash too many times, and you have to pay for damages, but the amount you have to pay depends on the bike that you are riding. Once you have completed the first five circuits, you have to race them again another four times - but at a much more difficult level. Manage to win all five circuits on all levels, and you win the Road Rash cup.<br><br>There are about five bikes to choose from, which are divided into three groups. Rat, Sport, and Super. You start the first level with a Rat bike, but as you proceed through the levels, it is important to pick bikes from a different bike class.<br><br>If you have no plans to win the Road Rash cup, you can choose the game's Thrash mode. The difference between this and the other mode is that there is no money involved (ie: you are not allowed to buy bikes), and you are competing against fourteen opponents. And if you wreck your bike or you get busted, you have to start all over again. Regardless of the mode you pick, you will always start in the last place.<br><br>The remake also contains FMV movies that usually depict the outcome of the races, as well as limited songs performed by various recording artists, including Soundgarden, Therapy?, Monster Magnet, and Swervedriver. These songs can be changed on-the-fly via the game's options menu.

Description="Shadowrun" for Sega CD is a little-known game (and one of the very last ones released for this console) that is based on the FASA RPG of the same name and has only very little to do with its much more popular brethren for SNES and Genesis.<br><br>It is twenty-first century, and the humanity faces a difficult period that follows devastating wars and other disasters. Magic and technology co-exist, supernatural powers, mythical creatures, ghosts, cyberspace, where hackers meet and fight each other, street deckers which can be hired to do the dirty work, anarchy and struggle between mighty and corrupt corporation - this is the world of Shadowrun. Unlike the two other Shadowrun games which are set in Seattle, according to tradition, "Shadowrun" for Sega CD is set in the futuristic Neo Tokyo. You control a party of characters with different backgrounds: the street samurai Rikudo, the shaman girl Mao, the decker (a hired mercenary) D-Head who also happens to be an elf, and Shiun, a former member of a mighty corporation. Your first assignment is to hunt down a ghostly warrior who has been disturbing the piece of the city for quite some time. As you begin your investigation, you plunge deeper into the dark work of intrigues and find yourself fighting on different fronts.<br><br>"Shadowrun" for Sega CD (unlike its two other counterparts) is a distinctly Japanese game. It is a hybrid of Japanese adventure along the lines of  Snatcher and turn-based party RPG. In adventure mode, you interact with the game world by choosing commands ("Look", "Talk", "Move", etc.) from a menu. There are no real puzzles, but rather realistic detective work: you talk to people, gather evidence, access the internet, talk to informers, and so on. But often you find yourself in places where you navigate your characters from a top-down view and fight enemies. The battles occupy the whole screen, and you can move around the battle field, using melee, long-ranged, and magic attacks, like in early  Ultima games. The outcome of an attack is decided by a dice roll. You can stop the dices yourself, or you can let the computer do the rolling for you. There are also cyberspace fights which occur when you encounter a hostile hacker in the matrix world.

Basketball is merely the subject for the game's plot, involving the new-guy, Ace (the player), and a host of other characters, basketball players or just spectators, all with different personalities. It's basically play one-on-one on a warehouse court and climb the "ladders" until you earn enough respect to play against Scottie Pippen.<br><br>The game features a total of 13 characters, 5 of which the player has an option to play against, all of which are played by real actors.

Its true nature and purpose are unknown. Is it some country's secret weapon, or an alien from another world? They appear in the winter, killing people and taking their place in society. They wear artificial skin and can sweat and even bleed. They are called "Snatchers" because they "snatch" their victims before they take their place.<br><br>A new police force, specifically trained to fight the Snatchers, has been formed. They are JUNKERs (Judgement Uninfected Naked Kind and Execute Rangers). Every time you encounter someone, a difficult question must be asked  IS IT A PERSON OR A SNATCHER?<br><br>You are Gillian Seed, one of the JUNKERs. Your mission is largely adventure-based, with manga-style graphics and voice acting. Each room has objects to pick up, examine and use. Conversation with other characters is a key plot element. A few short shooting gallery type scenes add an action element. While the game is generally scary or comic, a few moments border on the sensual.

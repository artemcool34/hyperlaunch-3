Description=Based on the scripts of the 21st movie "Casino Royale" and the 22nd James Bond movie of the same name as the game, it follows closely the story of those movies but elaborates many scenes and fills in some blanks.<br><br>In a first person shooter fashion, the player directs Bond through the levels filled with many bad guys. To overcome those, Bond has several different kinds of weapons at his disposal ranging from his trusted P99, over machine guns to full blown grenade launchers. But the levels are also filled with canisters that either explode upon shooting or vent gas that temporarily blinds the enemy. Bond can also perform a take down move which puts an enemy out silently. If Bond is near enough to an enemy, a button press will initiate the corresponding mini-game in which the player needs to hit a circle with a crosshair in a short period of time. Is the player successful,  the enemy is out of the play but when he fails to hit the mark in time, Bond will be thrown away from the enemy and is vulnerable for a short period of time. In addition Bond can duck into cover to avoid bullets and shoot blindly over it or look out of it to get the kill. Bond also automatically regenerates his health when not under fire.<br><br>Other obstacles in the levels are cameras, which can either be shot or disabled and electronic locks which need to be hacked in another mini-game. There arrows flash green or red on the screen and the player needs to press the corresponding button fast enough when it blink green to input the right number into the keypad.<br><br>The game also features a multiplayer mode for up to 12 players with the following game modes:<br><br>1. Bond Versus: one player takes over the control of James Bond and either needs to defuse two of the three bombs in the level or kill all six of the opposing team. In this mode Bond can also see all enemies and has two lives.<br><br>2. Golden Gun: the first player to score 100 points wins the round. Points are earned by kills but if the player is holding the always visible power weapon called "Golden Gun", he scores 6 points per kill.<br><br>3. Bond Evasion: in this mode one member of the MI6-team randomly gets to be Bond and needs to get to the escape point of the map to win the round for his team. Meanwhile The Organization tries to stop him by either killing him or preventing him to reach the escape points in time.

Description=Alien Crush Returns is a modern-day update to the classic TurboGrafx-16 title Alien Crush. It is a downloadable WiiWare-exclusive title, and considered the fourth title in the Crush Pinball series.<br><br>It contains three tables or stages with 3-D polygonal graphics and online leaderboards. The ability to "tilt" the table remains, and is accomplished through motion control.  Operating the paddles is done with simple button presses on the Wii Remote or Nunchuck.<br><br>The game features Action Balls, which are special abilities that can be applied to the ball during gameplay.  For instance, one action will add brief extra speed to the ball that allows it to bounce and rebound further, and crash through some obstacles off which the ball would normally just bounce. The actions must be earned, and there is a draw-down time between uses, as multiple uses may be saved up. Alien Crush Returns also saves high scores for one player, and features a story mode about a struggle between aliens and space marines, and occasional boss battles.

Each one of them have their own weapons and special attacks.<br><br>When you start the game, you can select any one of these characters to play as. There are six missions to complete (eight in the Genesis version) with several stages, and each mission has you blasting aliens all the way to the end, from the streets to the mother ship where you'll meet the mother of all aliens. Unfortunately, blasting these aliens will not be an easy task, as they get tougher in every mission, and are capable of hiding into objects such as plants, postboxes, trashcans, drums, and several others. Each mission has an objective such as rescuing people destroying an UFO.<br><br>When you deal with a few aliens, flying heads will appear, which you can shoot to collect life or energy (by the way, life is important to you, since if yours get empty, you're dead). However, rather than using your ordinary weapons, you can use the special attacks that are enough to kill aliens you currently see. These types of attack vary depending on the character you choose at the start of the game. For instance, Gordon summons a U.S. Air Force Jet that drop bombs across the street, while Scooter is able to teleport out of his present location, and leave a series of bombs that will blow up aliens on sight, he will then re-appear. However, using your character's special attack uses up a lot of energy, and if you have little or no energy, you can't use it.<br><br>At the end of some missions is an alien boss, which you must destroy in order to complete the mission. Also, at the end of every one, you have to enter buildings where you participate in a shooting gallery. The object is to kill aliens popping up from several locations with the building. <br><br>You can play Alien Storm by yourself, or with another person.

Description=Alien Syndrome is a top down shooter inspired by Sega's original Alien Syndrome action game. The games story takes place thousands of years in the future; by this point in time mankind has explored many parts of the galaxy and established numerous colonies. One such colony, Seti-Alpha 5 (SAT5), has ceased communications for some reason and it is your job to head to SAT5 and investigate what went wrong. Upon arrival, you encounter the alien syndrome, a force which can mutate man and machine into deadly aliens. These events take place roughly 100 years after those in the original Alien Syndrome game.<br><br>When you begin the game you can select one of several characters as well as choose a character specialty (such as demolitions expert, firebug,  seal, tank, and sharpshooter). The specialty you select will determine your initial character stats; as you play through the game you earn levels which provide you points to allocate towards improving your stats. The character stats help determine your characters accuracy in ranged  or close attacks, speed, healing power, resistance to fire/radiation, armor strength, and so on.<br><br>Similar to the original game, the action is viewed top down. You'll need to explore the numerous corridors and rooms found on SAT5 and eliminate the numerous alien invaders found there. Mission objectives are often provided to you which need to be completed. Additional weapons, ammo, and other useful items can be found throughout the levels. Your character has a limited amount of energy, and if all energy is lost then you will need to begin again at the last checkpoint crossed.

Description=And Yet It Moves is a platform game with puzzle elements where the goal is simply to complete each of the levels. The twist is that next to regular movement (left, right, jumping), the player is also able to rotate the game world in instances of ninety degrees, both left and right. That way, the environment can be explored in different directions. Even though it becomes possible to complete a level without the movement keys, it is mainly used for puzzles. Players need to take out enemies by moving items from the environment, guide a shadow character that mirror the player's actions, or do complex sets of platform jumping including bouncing ledges and swings. By quickly rotating, the velocity can be increased to dazzling speeds, but when the character hits the ground too fast or from too high a distance, he will be killed.<br><br>After every section there is a checkpoint and there is an unlimited amount of tries per level. The graphical style is envisioned as a world of paper cut-outs, in regard to the player's character as well as every item in the environment. There are also different themes for the levels, including fire, jungle and rocks. The game is divided into three main acts and an epilogue. Next to the main game mode, the levels can be played in competition for the fastest times, with global high score leaderboards as well as ghosts of other players.

The game plays like a standard action-based platformer. The levels feature plenty of enemies and gaps you must jump over. Your only weapon are sticks of dynamite. When you throw a stick, it will bounce off the floor and explode only after a couple of seconds, so very precise aiming and timing are needed to defeat the enemies. Many levels contain optional treasure chests as well as hidden doors that lead to bonus levels. Sometimes level progression is non-linear, i.e. you can jump straight to a high-numbered zone if you find the correspondent door on the level. All the levels are timed.

Next to a line of dialogue, it shakes the player's camera and rumbles the Wii remote. There are ten characters to choose from (Randy Daytona, Maggie, Feng, The Dragon, Freddy "Fingers" Wilson, Yukito Nagasaki, Karl Wolfschtagg, Master Wong, Young Randy and The Hammer), but only the first six are available right way.

Accordingly, each instrument has its own 'career' path in game.<br><br>If you are doing the vocals for your band, you have to sing along in time to the music, matching the pitch as closely as possible. Lead and bass guitar is played by holding down the fret buttons and strumming as the appropriate fret icons cross the strike line on screen. Drums are done similar to the guitars, hitting the correct drum pad's/cymbals at the correct time. The better you do, the more points you score, however if you make too many mistakes, you will fail the song.<br><br>You can either play alone on any of the instrument careers, or you can play with up to three friends on one console or online to compete with other players and bands from across the world.<br><br>Songs featured include Duran Duran's Rio, Don McLean's American Pie, Evanescence's Bring Me To Life and Queen's Crazy Little Thing Called Love.

Players control Batman and a tag-along superhero partner (which differs from episode to episode) and fight various villains as they save Gotham City and beyond.  Enemies drop coins which can be used to upgrade gadgets, as well as purchase new ones.  If a player loses all their health, they loose 100 coins and are respawned back into the game to continue the crimefighting.  Each player has a special Jump-in Hero they can select, who can help them with a powerful attack every so often (similar to using magic in Golden Axe).<br><br>The game is not limited to two players, however.  If you have a Nintendo DS and the DS version of The Brave and The Bold, you can link the DS up to the Wii, allowing a third player to play as the Batman-obsessed, magical tagalong, Bat-Mite.  Bat-Mite controls differently from other characters.  He can fly around the screen anywhere, and can assist the heroes by conjuring health or energy pickups, or try to help fight by dropping anvils and bombs out of nowhere.  However, just like in the show, Bat-Mite can be a nuisance to the heroes too - his attacks will damage other players if they don't avoid them!

The game contains cover versions of 30 popular songs of which each one has five different versions based on the aforementioned styles. The notes scroll up from the bottom of the screen near the top and players need to swing the Wiimote in the right direction at the right moment. The game is always played against another opponent (human or computer) with a similar playfield on the other side of the screen. Both players play the same song, but with a different style. Based on the performance, the style of the player performing best is heard dominantly. When the other player improves, the volume is adjusted into the other direction and as such the song is constantly mixed based on the different styles.<br><br>Contrary to contemporary music games, missing a note does not influence the music itself, only the shift in volume towards a certain player. There are also different attacks to use while playing. The opponent's screen can be covered in smoke, have their controls reversed, or notes can even be shrunken or flipped around. There are also certain Face Off instances where the players take turns playing a part, launching attacks, while the other player can block through syncing.

Description=Bit. Trip Beat is a unique combination of Pong and a rhythm game. The game is played by holding the Wii-remote sideways and tilting it away or towards the body. This in turn moves a paddle on the left side of the screen vertically up or down. The objective of the game is to hit the various "balls" with the paddle coming into the screen from the right. The balls are synchronized with the beat of the game's chiptune soundtrack, creating a logical connection between what players are seeing and what they are hearing.<br><br>The screen contains two bars. Hitting a ball will fill up the top bar until it is full. This increases the multiplier and makes the visual effects in the background more complex, thus increasing the difficulty. The lower bar is emptied if the player misses a ball. If the bottom bar is depleted, the game switches into a black and white mode, similar to the original Pong game, where only the Wii-remote's speaker is active. In this mode, the player has to fill the top bar again to return to normal play. If the bottom bar runs out again, the game is over.<br><br>Bit. Trip Beat has a variety of balls the player has to repel. They are colour-coded to indicate their movement type: orange balls bounce off the paddle multiple times, while yellow balls only travel in a straight line for example. Occasionally, bonus items can be picked up with the paddle, which for example change the paddle's size similar to the power-ups found in Breakout.<br><br>At the end of each level, a boss fight awaits the player. Defeating the boss grants access to the next level, of which there are a total of three. After playing through a level once, it can be selected at the main menu.

But to do that is not simple at all. Bumping into trees and rocks, king Suren can bring his soldiers to life. Once there are some knights in his small army, he will also be able to free imprisoned soldiers. King Ogreth's units will constantly attack you on the way. The results of the battles are calculated automatically, according to the strength of your units. So before you engage in a battle, you have to be sure you have the upper hand (you have gathered enough soldiers, they have trained in easier battles, etc.). If king Suren dies in a battle, the game is over - you'll have to start from the beginning no matter how near you were to your goal.

Description=Black Bomberman has cut power to the galaxy's own power station, which resulted in disputes between seven planets, and it is up to White Bomberman to restore power to the station and bring peace to the planets again. The objective is the same as in Dyna Blaster: use bombs to destroy all enemies in a level. Once you have destroyed them all, find the exit hidden in a block so you can be transported to the next level. A block will also flash yellow to let you know that a power-up can be obtained there. Power-ups include more bombs, manual detonation, extra lives, and extended flames. Occasionally, you also get the ability to walk through bombs or walls, or to kick bombs.<br><br>If you manage to reveal the exit before all enemies are destroyed, it remains in an "inactive" state, meaning that you cannot be transported to the next level until you blow up all the enemies and therefore making it "active". If you accidentally blow up the exit, whether it is active or not, or if time runs out, you will unleash a few enemies that you also need to destroy. After every eighth level, there is a boss that you need to destroy to proceed to the next planet.<br><br>Besides this Normal mode, there are two other modes: Battle and Versus. In Battle, you can play against four human- or computer-controlled players in one of seven stages, each with different features like warp holes, conveyor belts, revolving doors, and much more. In Versus, you play head-to-head against a friend using the TurboExpress for non-stop action. Regardless of these two modes, you can still obtain power-ups to give out some punishment against your fellow players, and the maximum number of wins can be set before play.

Description=The third main Call of Duty game centers around Operation Cobra in Normandy, France, the World War II operation planned by United States Army General Omar Bradley to break out from the Normandy area after the previous month's D-Day landings. You play as 4 allied sides with American, Canadian, British and Polish soldiers in 14 chronological singleplayer missions covering the 88 days leading up to the liberation of Paris. Surprisingly, you cannot play as the French 2nd Armored Division that actually liberated Paris.<br><br>The battles are usually dramatic with many fights and scripted events at the same time, consisting of infantry and vehicles, with semi-destructible environments. In between, there are cinematics that explain the events. A few gameplay mechanics have been kept intact or make a return: slight auto aim, the damage system that allows you to recover if you hide for a moment, and smoke grenades. New features include the ability to toss back unexploded grenades and actions requiring a successful series of button combinations. This can occur in hand-to-hand combat where you can yank the weapon out of enemy soldiers' hands. Enemies work in groups, try different tactics and search for cover.<br><br>The main multiplayer modes are standard deathmatch (battle), team deathmatch (team battle), Capture the Flag (either with two flags or two sides trying to control a single, neutral flag) and Headquarters (two sides either defend or attack a structure, and players can now respawn after dying). The new mode, War, is similar to the gameplay of the Battlefield series. Two teams start with two control points each, and one neutral flag in the middle. The objective is to control all five flags.<br><br>There are multiple-occupancy vehicles (Sherman Tank, Panzer IV, Jeep, Horch, BMW, Harley), and several multiplayer classes: Rifleman, Heavy Assault, Light Assault, Medic, Scout, Support and Anti-Armor. Each class has unique abilities. There are also two rankings: a normal rank system during a single game where your abilities improve if you do well, and an overall TrueSkill ranking. Also, unlike the previous games, your team stays grouped together after a match and is not booted back to the lobby right away.

Description=Call of Duty: World at War is, like its predecessors, a straightforward military first-person shooter with authentic weaponry like the Thompson Sub Machine Gun or the Arisaka Rifle Type 99, and fairly linear but heavily scripted levels that put the player right in the middle of the action with several NPC-controlled team mates always on his side to aid him and add to the atmosphere. The objectives in these missions range from clearing houses from enemies to planting bombs or defend a position. And instead of using medipacks or something similar to heal himself up, the player just needs to get out of fire for a few seconds to regenerate to full health. New this time around is the co-op campaign for up to four players, allowing everyone to play through the whole single player together with friends.<br><br>The first campaign begins on August 17, 1942 somewhere on the Makin-Atoll in the Asian-Pacific region where Pvt. Miller sits in a hut and has to watch how his squadmates are brutally murdered by Japanese soldiers. But as one soldier approaches him and prepares for the killing blow, an American bayonet comes out of his stomach. Now the roles are turned and in the following operations Pvt. Miller, under the supervision of Sgt. Roebuck, stills his lust for vengeance by helping the American troops drive back the yellow menace in recreations of real missions like "Operation Watchtower".<br><br>The second campaign puts the player in the shoes of Pvt. Petrenko and begins on September 17, 1942 in Stalingrad. Lying in a pool of blood, watching how the Germans put one more bullet in his dying comrades, the private survives and under the helpful guidance of Sgt. Reznov begins his journey through the destroyed city to the main goal: killing General Heinrich Amsel.<br><br>The game also features a multiplayer mode similar to the one from Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare with the playtypes Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Capture the Flag, and Search & Destroy in which one team needs to plant a bomb at one of two objectives and the other needs to defend both. The ranking system also makes a return. For every kill or completed objective the player gains experience points and levels up to unlock additional weaponry, attachments or abilities granting a higher accuracy and such. These then can be used to create up to five custom classes in addition to the five pre-defined ones (Rifleman, Light Gunner, Heavy Gunner, Close Assault and Sniper).

The series was partially licensed to North America under the name Case Closed, hence the different game title used outside Japan. The franchise is centered around High School Detective Shinichi Kudo (or Jimmy Kudo in Case Closed) who after being drugged by a mysterious organization transforms into a shrinked version of himself, alias Conan Edogawa. After this event, he continues to solve various cases together with detective Mouri (Moore).<br><br>The Mirapolis Investigation is an original story and begins as detective Richard Moore (Kogoro Mouri) is invited to the opening ceremony of an amusement park called Mirapolis, with the owner's intention of promoting it using his popularity, as is often the case in the anime series.

Soon after the opening the first murder takes place and Conan must once again find the culprit.<br><br>The player controls Conan from a third-person perspective as he explores the Mirapolis facilities: the Hotel, the Annex, the Gym and the Courtyard. To solve the crimes, he needs to collect information from various characters, and sometimes analyse the physical evidence in a point-and-click fashion.

Description=As an undercover agent of Chase Headquarters, your job is to patrol the streets and track down five criminals. You are given a mission briefing before you start which gives information on the suspect and what car they drive. Then you drive across the city without crashing into other cars, and catch up with the criminal's car. To arrest the suspects, you must keep bumping into their car until it is no longer functional. And you have to do this under a strict time limit. You can't afford to crash into cars or buildings or you waste time getting on the road again. <br><br>However, once you've caught up with your suspect, you are given more time. Your car is also equipped with turbo boosts, which you can use to gain extra speed if you are way behind the criminal. Each arrest is based on a "suspicion".

Using a heavy-designed machine with a V6 DOHC 3000CC Twin Turbo Engine, five sets of nitro-fuel boosts, and a gun attached to the steering wheel (which you can use to damage the target vehicle), your mission is to patrol the streets and find these vehicles.<br><br>The gameplay is similar to Chase H.Q., but there are a few differences. For example, cars travel in both directions instead of one, and some of them will catch up to your car and shoot at you. At least once in every stage a helicopter does a fly by and drops you some grenades you can use to further damage the target vehicle. A guy on a motorcycle will catch up to you and throw grenades at your car. And, most importantly, as mentioned earlier, you can shoot at the target vehicle rather than just bumping into it.<br><br>Have fun driving around, but remember, there is a strict time limit, so I wouldn't waste time or keep crashing into things if I were you.

Description=Chew Man Fu has set a curse to rob the world of fried rice, egg rolls and all its other favourite foods. To stop him you must work through 550 rounds, clearing them by placing four different coloured balls into the appropriately-coloured hole.<br><br>Gameplay is something of a Pengo variant, as the single-screen levels are inhabited by enemies, who can be killed by firing one of the balls at them at speed. When it hits one it will continue moving in the same direction, rebounding off walls if neccessary, and pushing you backwards slightly if it comes back to you - but it can be instantaneously brought back under control. Blocks can also be moved at a more casual speed, including round corners. Once a block is placed onto its spot, it can be used again as a weapon. The levels are in a maze style, and parts of this can be opened up. The game also includes a small bonus Kick-Ball game for 2 players, which doubles as practice with the control system.

The game's mysterious story follows two humans, always up above the critters and takes place in the desert and a gas station.<br><br>The game is essentially a fighting game, with the Wii-remote and nun-chuck being used for various special moves to defeat the mostly insect foes.

Description=Dead Rising: Chop Till you Drop is an adaptation of Dead Rising, for the Wii. The freelance photojournalist Frank West investigates a zombie outbreak in Willamette, Colorado. He has three days at the mall to rescue survivors and solve the case before the helicopter that dropped him off returns.<br><br>The basic outlines are maintained from the Xbox 360 game, but numerous changes have been made to fit the game into the Resident Evil 4 engine and to accommodate the Wii's graphical capabilities and very different controller. The plot is the same and Frank saves the same people, though a few are missing. The map of the mall is almost the same, but Frank can no longer jump and it adds new barriers and eliminates some shortcuts, which changes navigation. While the game is still primarily about killing crowds of zombies, there are fewer of them and they are more aggressive. The cut-scenes are also unchanged, though they are now pre-rendered, but the structure of the game has been overhauled. You can have multiple save slots. It is no longer a real-time affair, but a series of missions given in sequence. Otis the janitor gives Frank side missions which are timed. You are scored on these missions based on how long it takes to complete them (or whether you complete them at all), the number of zombies Frank kills and the damage he takes. High scores result in more side missions and top scores earn various items. After a batch of side missions is done, you are given the next plot mission. These are untimed and represent Franks only real opportunity to wander around the mall. He still level-ups, but the bonuses he gains are different. Health is now a solid bar rather than discrete boxes, so the bar length just increases a little with each level instead of adding a box at specified points. Frank gets bonuses to weapon durability and damage and to book capacity, which is separated from the rest of the inventory. Books are used strictly for teaching him new moves for specific weapons or for unarmed fighting.<br><br>While he still can pick up and use numerous objects as weapons, from sensible choices like katanas and bats to silly ones like cash registers and shower heads to things that are more transports than weapons, like shopping carts, skateboards and bicycles, the number of usable items has been greatly reduced. Melee weapons all wear out and break with use. There are two classes. Smaller items can be pocketed, allowing Frank to fire a gun. Larger items, like rototillers and chainsaws, are dropped if he is attacked or enters gun mode. He can only have one melee weapon of each type at a time. These weapons cannot go into the inventory, which is used strictly for food and mixables and ammo-based weapons. There are multiple kinds of food which can be eaten to recover health or mixed in blenders to create shakes with various effects. Food can be found laying around the environment, recovered from dead zombies or found inside trash cans and boxes. These breakable items way also contain melee weapons. Dead zombies can also drop cash and ammunition.<br><br>The camera throughout the game has been changed to an over-the-shoulder view. When you go into gun mode, the camera zooms in and you aim manually using the remote. Other limited-supply weapons such as saw blades and molotov cocktails are also used this way. The role of guns has been greatly expanded. There are now five basic kinds of guns, pistols, shotguns, machine guns, rifles and magnums. Each has its own kind of ammunition. The ammunition does not take inventory space, though the guns do. Early in the game, there is a mission that gives access to a gun shop, after which you can buy better guns, for instance, replacing the rifle with a semi-automatic rifle. This is also where you buy increased ammunition capacity and books.<br><br>As before, missions are mixed between fighting bosses, which the game calls psychopaths and rescuing survivors (or frequently rescuing a survivor from a boss). Frank is now limited to escorting three survivors at a time and must do the survivor missions one at a time. Most of the boss fights are essentially the same, where he fights a powerful human enemy. Some of the bosses have had their story segments eliminated and are present as super-zombies. These super-zombies are visually distinct, have special attacks and drop bonuses when killed. Another boss fight has been converted to a QTE, where you must press buttons quickly when prompted. The game also adds new animal zombies, which are grenade-dropping parrots and very fast poodles.

Your job is to roll into color-filled machines, which fill you with that color, and then touch buildings, walls, billboards, trees and Graydiants to restore their color.  You can mix colors by rolling into two different primary colors (for example, blue and yellow gives you green).  Some buildings are secured and cannot be colored simply by touching them - instead, de Blob jumps inside them and the player must shake the Wii Remote to fill them with color.<br><br>Each area has gates that are sealed up - these can be opened by earning enough points.  Points can be earned for all sorts of things - painting blocks of buildings, freeing Graydiants, completing challenges, and more.  Once the player has earned enough points, they'll open up the exit to the level and can leave whenever they wish.<br><br>There are also hazards for de Blob - water will wash off your color, and you'll steadily lose your supply of paint if you remain in it.  There are also ink pools and I.N.K.T. agents which stain you black if you let them.  When black, any of your colored objects that you touch lose their color, and your supply of paint drains much faster than normal.

Description=Defend Your Castle is a remake of the developers' earlier flash-based online game; also called Defend Your Castle.  Though many changes have been made, the story and objective remains the same: defend your castle!<br><br>Play is with the Wii Remote only.  When people attack your castle, you pick them up and fling them away with the A or B button, or use various offensive spells with the d-pad.  As the rounds advance, so will the enemies: more types of enemies will appear, and at a faster rate.  Money earned by destroying invaders can be used between levels to fund development of major castle towers, or to increase the &quot;health&quot; of the castle.  When playing multiplayer, the one with the highest score in the current round is declared King and gets to decide how the money is spent.  Play continues until your castle is taken, but with the ability to save between each round there's the chance to give it another try.<br><br>Enemies can also be dropped into a Pit of Conversion to turn them to your side.  Though they won't fight directly, you can assign them to one of the castle's towers, each representing a different skill.  Stone masons will increase the castle's rate of repair.  Archers will pick off incoming invaders.  The more mages there are, the more offensive spells will be available and the more quickly they'll recharge.  Demolition men... explode.<br><br>Unlike its predecessor, the Wii game is made to look as if it's made from everyday household items come to life:  Men have crayon-drawn bodies and buttons for heads.  Clouds of tissue paper on string move across the sky.  One of the spells uses an eraser to erase an opponent.  Even the players' cursors are those little hard plastic bread ties.

Description=With Andy going to college, Woody, Buzz and the rest of the toys have ended up in a daycare called Sunnyside.  A teddy bear called Lotso runs the place, but it quickly becomes apparent that not everything's sunny in Sunnyside after all...  Disney/Pixar Toy Story 3 takes you through the toys' adventures that lead them to Sunnyside and beyond, as well as places not seen in the film, such as Bonnie's caffeine-fuelled imagination.<br><br>The game features two different modes - the first is Story Mode, which has the toys retelling the events of the movie to their new found friends.  In this mode, players take control of Woody, Jessie and Buzz, each with their own unique moves to help them explore the world.  Story Mode revisits Andy's imagination of Woody in the wild west, lets players play the Buzz Lightyear videogame seen at the start of Toy Story 2, has them breaking out of Sunnyside in a stealth level, and even takes them to a Haunted Bakery!  Each level has secret cards hidden throughout - these cards unlock special bonuses such as concept art, a short making of movie, and best of all, new toys for the Toy Box Mode.<br><br>Toy Box Mode is a deeper experience than Story Mode.  In this mode, players can explore all of the world of Woody's Roundup as either Woody, Buzz or Jessie (as well as Emperor Zurg in the PlayStation 3 version).  In this mode, players build a town for Mayor Hamm using the money they find by completing missions, which can be anything from rescuing cows, to destroying a dam, to taking photos of people or places, to racing in a giant stunt track, to catching bank robbers and throwing them in jail, to pretty much anything!<br><br>Money can be used to buy new toys, such as new town buildings, Micro Machines-style racers, Bullseye the horse (to ride), and even new citizens for your town.  You can also redecorate your town any way you like, using the items you find in toy capsules strewn all over the landscape.  These items can be used to change the look of your buildings, or the citizens themselves - you can change their hairstyle, clothes, or give them a new hat.  Some special missions are given using a ViewMaster-style toy where you look at pictures which give you clues on how to dress up toys or buildings (such as making four citizens look like a mariachi band and then placing them in front of the saloon).

Make people happy by retrieving balloons, preventing bored fans from leaving a concert, and demolishing cities to help a father find his apartment.

Minon can use the dominoes to reach distant areas and interact with characters, but he must complete his goal before he runs out of both time and "Minonade" (the source of his powers that lets him drop dominoes).  While there are some vague similarities to the PlayStation game No One Can Stop Mr. Domino, there really are more differences than similarities - the main one being that Minon places dominoes in front of him, while Mr. Domino drops them behind him and hits the first one at the end of a level.<br><br>Minon cannot reverse, which is a key reason why he needs the dominos in front of him.  Players aim where they want the next set of dominoes to be placed using the Wii Remote and then drop them with the B Button.  The A Button makes Minon stop.  Sometimes, Minon may start to lose his balance - if this occurs, the player needs to tilt the Wii Remote forward and back until he's stable once more.

Once the rivets are removed from the final level, Donkey Kong falls, and the two lovers are reunited.  From there, the levels start over at a higher difficulty.<br><br>Along the way, Mario must dodge a constant stream of barrels, "living" fireballs, and spring-weights.  Although not as powerful as in other future games, Mario can find a hammer which allows him to destroy the barrels and fireballs for a limited amount of time.  Additionally, Mario can also find Pauline's hat, purse and umbrella for additional bonus points.<br><br>Donkey Kong is also notable for being one of the first complete narratives in video game form, told through simplistic cut scenes that advance the story.  It should also be noted that in versions of the game for early 1980's consoles, Donkey Kong only used 2-3 of the original levels, with the cement factory usually omitted.

In 1978, TK (who was then an 18-year-old driver-for-hire who had just graduated from high school) was sentenced to 28 years in prison for a crime he did not commit, and is released from prison in 2006. Now, with his driving skills, he seeks revenge against the police department for having to serve time for something someone else should've gone to prison for!<br><br>Unlike Driv3r, Driver: Parallel Lines mostly takes place behind the wheel, returning back to the formula that made the first game a classic. The game still has a GTA-style open-ended design, though, and you can still exit your vehicle for some on-foot action. However, there's no reason to exit your vehicle unless it's damaged and you can no longer drive it, as almost all of the game's missions involve cop car chases. If that's the case, then you can either go to the repair shop to repair your vehicle, or just steal someone else's vehicle! Until then, you can punch the cops with your fists and steal their weapons when they're dead, so that you can use them for future on-foot combat.<br><br>The game takes place in both 1978 (before TK went to prison) and in 2006. The 2006 setting has a much more modern soundtrack than the 1978 setting, which has a mostly disco soundtrack. Obviously, the 2006 setting has the architecture, technology, and cars of today.

The main focus of the game is exploration of the game world and cataloguing the various species of animals found there.

There are still treasures to find, but as Endless Ocean is mostly freeform exploration and has no overarching plot, the player is in no obligation to look for these items to progress through the game.<br><br>Unlike in the similar Aquanaut's Holiday, only a small area of the full game world is seamlessly accessible at any one time. Diving tours are limited to a certain area around the player's boat, which can be freely moved about a map of the whole game world. This allows the player to choose for themselves the area of the game world they can access without having to bear loading times; however it is not possible to move from one play area to another without returning to the boat and using the map to move it around.<br><br>The game keeps track of the species of animals encountered and examined in three levels of detail - no information and three small pieces of information on each species. The animals are mostly marine life - fish, dolphins, whales, sea lions - but also include various coastal and marine birds, such as penguins and pelicans. There are a number of extra features that unlock during the first few hours of gameplay, including night diving, an underwater camera/photo album and an aquarium the player can populate with species of animals they've encountered in the open sea.<br><br>This title also adds online multiplayer to the series, allowing for players to use Nintendo's WFC service to go diving together.

You can also use other tools such as fish food, a whistle, a multi-sensor (for salvaging items) and a camera.<br><br>The game features a main story to follow, but players can take it at their own pace, or decide to try some of the side-missions, such as dolphin training, filling an aquarium with fish to display, managing your private reef, mapping out areas you've visited and selling the maps for profit, salvaging treasure, pursuing special requests and treasure rumours, taking on photo requests for magazines, and even taking guided tours around locations you've already visited.  Completing certain milestones in the game awards you "titles", which act as an achievement system.  You can give yourself any title that you've unlocked to use as an identifier, and even mix and match them.<br><br>Endless Ocean: Blue World supports 2 player simultaneous multiplayer.  Two divers can explore the ocean together, and send text messages to each other to communicate.  If players have Wii Speak, they can talk to each other while diving as well.  During online dives, main story quests cannot be completed and new creatures that you discover will not be recorded in your encyclopedia.

Description=A launch game for the Nintendo Wii, Excite Truck is the "sequel" to the Excitebike games for the NES and N64.   The term sequel is used lightly, because now instead of playing on motorcycles, you are racing monstrous trucks across constantly transforming outdoors terrains.  <br><br>Like its predecessors, Excite Truck is a racing game pitting you against multiple opponents or other players.  Players have the ability to play in tournaments against NPC's to unlock medals, play head to head, or play a single-player special mode.  Single player features a mode that allows players to go up against computer-controlled trucks in a competition with two branching difficulties across 4 medal challenges (bronze, silver, medal, platinum).  The multiplayer head-to-head also allows for two players to race their trucks against each other, but without the use of the other NPC trucks.  Special modes include a slalom challenge, a leap-through-rings jumping challenge, and a demolition derby.  Players race on outdoor tracks in a number of locales from Fiji to Scotland.  The map is littered with obstacles such as jumps, water hazards, and cliffs to impede your progress.<br><br>Instead of using a traditional joystick, the game is specifically designed around the Wii remote's motion sensing ability.  The controller is held sideways without the nunchuk attached, like a steering wheel.  Players tilt the controller left and right to turn their truck.  In the air, players can tilt the remote back and forth to lean their truck forward or backwards.  The #2 button is used for gas, and the D-pad can be used for a turbo.<br><br>The term "Excite" is not just used to make the game look like the sequel to an old NES classic.  Excite Truck features a complete loss of realism, emphasis on turbo, and chaotic game play.  Players have the ability to push their truck's speed far past physical limitations, and jumps can be used to achieve jump heights akin to the N64 game San Francisco Rush.  Simply by picking up icons, players or even NPC's can reform the land to make shortcuts and ramps.  The game encourages the players' use of turbo, and even emphasizes chaotic driving through its overuse.  Some stunts may even be rewarded by more boost or a power-up.<br><br>Pulling off these maneuvers is not just a feature, but a core mechanic that is used to progress through the game.  Like the Burnout series, performing death-defying stunts not only benefits the player, but rewards them with "star points".  These points are what actually unlocks new modes and races.  While coming in first place is important to earn more star points, it may not be necessary if the player drives crazy enough during the race.<br><br>Using an SD card, the game's soundtrack can be customized with MP3s.

The game also has a difficult to perform 'Facebreaker' move - if you perform this move on your opponent, you instantly win the match.<br><br>You can throw low punches and high punches, grab your opponent, or perform a strong attack.  By repeatedly attacking with low or high punches, you'll build up your 'Breaker Meter'.  If you hit with a strong attack when the Breaker Meter is filled, you'll perform a Hay, Bone, Ground, Sky or Facebreaker - depending on how full it is.  You can also use the shoulder button to block.  If you block and use your low or high punch before your opponent hits you, you'll perform a Parry, which counters their oncoming attack.<br><br>The game also allows you to custom-create your own boxers.  You can do this either just by using the game's editor on its own, or, if you have a camera, you can take a photo and the editor can use that as a starting point for your fighter.

Description=The 2008 edition of the long-running EA FIFA football franchise improves upon the gameplay and the features of the previous installments. It is the first game in the series to appear on the Wii and the PS3. Statistically, it includes 620 licensed teams, 30 national leagues (3 more than in FIFA Soccer 07), with the addition of the Hyundai A-League (Australia), Czech Gambrinus Liga (Czech Republic) and FAI Premier Division (Ireland). As usual, the leagues have been updated with new teams and prominent football countries (England, France, Germany, Italy and Spain) have multiple divisions. There are also 23 clubs from around the world not featured in specific leagues.<br><br>Gameplay changes include a revised shooting simulation, where factors such as position, defence, speed, bounce and direction weigh in. This is a continuation of the dynamic shooting meter from the previous version, where the position and a shot power meter make for powerful distance shots. There is also more attention to through-balls, more fluent animations and skill moves, revamped crowd, cheering and stadium animations, and a redesigned tackle system. Next to the known modes, "Be A Pro" is introduced where players take control of a single, fixed player on the field. It is not a career mode, but mainly an alternative way to play the games. Online multiplayer options allow players to form a team of independently controlled players, with 10 human-controlled players at the same time in a single match. The camera is changed for this mode, to constantly keep the specific player, but also the action in focus.<br><br>FIFA Soccer 08 contains licensed music tracks from all around the world. Brazilian player Ronaldinho is the poster boy for this version, only replaced with prominent national players for specific localized versions, especially for the European countries.<br><br>The PS3 and Xbox 360 versions include online interactive leagues, with full national leagues against other players on EA servers. The game also comes with the tools to set up independent multiplayer games and organize tournaments.<br><br>The Wii version comes with the Footii Party mode, hosted by a Mii avatar of superstar Ronaldinho. Using the players' Mii characters there are mini-games of Table Football and Shoot Off. Players can also unlock Ronaldinho to go head-to-head in a skill contest. The controls are completely different from the other versions, dubbed FreeMotion. Through 30 tutorials at the Football Academy, players learn to dribble, shoot, pass and perform tricks with a flick of the wrist. The same depth is offered as in the other versions, with crosses, through passes and distance shots.

Description=Hironobu Sakaguchi's Final Fantasy... the first of one of the longest role-playing game series known to mankind. Final Fantasy is the game for the NES console that started it all.<br><br>The world is veiled in darkness. Winds don't blow, the seas are stormy, and the earth rots. All people can hope for is that the ancient prophecy will be finally fulfilled. "When the world is veiled in darkness, four warriors will come..." And indeed, they come - the four characters you have previously chosen. Their first quest is to free a princess from the evil Garland, and then the real journey begins...<br><br>Final Fantasy is played with an adventuring party rather than with a single character. Before the game starts, the player chooses four characters from six different classes: Fighter, Thief, Black Belt, White Mage, Red Mage, and Black Mage. Which four classes the player chooses for his characters is entirely up to him. He also gives the characters names. <br><br>In the game, the party walks around in a top-down world, visits cities, caves, palaces and other places to buy equipment, rest and get hints and new quests, and fights baddies when they are encountered. Final Fantasy uses a turn-based combat system; the ATB (active-time battle) system from the later installments is not used. In battle, the player gives each character in order a command (attack a particular enemy, cast a spell, use an item, or try to run.) Then the characters and the enemies act in a random order. Attacked enemies and party members lose hit points, dying when they reach zero HP. When all the enemies are defeated, living party members receive experience, eventually gaining a level and improving their stats when enough experience is accumulated. Slain party members can be revived in towns for a price. <br><br>Spells are bought in cities in special shops. The spells are divided into two categories - white magic and black magic. White Mages can only use white magic, Black Mages can only use black magic, and Red Mages can use both. Casting spells in battle uses up magic points, which, like hit points, can be restored by resting in inns.

Whereas in that game the player fought to rid the world of the deadly miasma covering it, in this game a land previously lost to the miasma is recovered and ripe for rebuilding.  Your purpose is to rebuild a prosperous kingdom with the magic power of architek, and along the way find out what happened to the previous king: your father.<br><br>Rather than controlling an adventurer or group of adventurers as in most Final Fantasy games, in My Life as a King you only have indirect control over such people.  As king you can hire people to become adventurers, who can then choose to go on behests.  Behests are essentially missions with bounties.  Every day some of the adventurers will gather around the behest boards and wait for the king to tell them if they should attempt it or not.  These missions will bring in the necessary resources of money and elementite, as well as knowledge of new lands and types of buildings.<br><br>To build the town, the king uses his power of architek and a limited amount of elementite to create buildings.  Some will house people, and can be used to supply adventurers and money through tithes.  Others will be shops adventurers will make purchases from, and at which the king can fund development of new products.  Some will be schools to teach magic or skills the adventurers can learn from; also at which the king can fund new developments.  Non-adventurer shops will keep the citizenry happy.<br><br>Game action is split into days.  At the beginning of each day you can read logs of what the adventurers did the previous day, down to specifics of what happened in each turn of the off-screen battles they had if you wish.  You then set behests, after which you are free to walk around the kingdom for the rest of the day and take pertinent actions such as creating buildings, funding research, approving adventurers for behests, or simply talking to the townspeople to keep up morale.

But, while their armies are kind and loyal, the recent actions of the King are anything but. The young Captain of the Red Wings, Cecil, is ordered to steal a crystal from a village of innocent magicians, and when he questions the actions of his King, Cecil is immediately thrown out of the country and sent off to kill strange monsters. Little does he realize the price the King's actions will pay, and what the true secret of the crystals, and their powers, truly is...<br><br>This is the first Final Fantasy game that introduced the famous ATB (active-time battle) system: during the battles, you have a time indicator for each party member that tells you when this character is able to act. If it takes you too long to select a command for this character, the enemy will act without waiting for your turn. The game abandons the job system that was implemented in the  first and the  third game in favor of pre-set character classes (paladin, white mage, ninja, etc.) assigned to each party member.<br><br>The PlayStation version adds a new rendered intro and ending.

The four boys decided to retrieve it from there and went down into an underground cave. But when they found the crystal, it spoke to them and from its words they understood they were chosen for a much more important and world-embracing mission...<br><br>Final Fantasy III is the third Final Fantasy game for the NES platform. It was the last Final Fantasy game that does not use the ATB (active time battle) system (until it was removed again in Final Fantasy X). The turn-based battle engine has been improved: if the enemy is defeated, the next character will automatically switch to another enemy, and not hit the air, like in the previous two games. <br><br>Before the game begins, you give names to the four boys, which look the same (only in different colors) and belong all to the same class - the scrawny Onion Kid. Very quickly, however, you're able to give your heroes "jobs" - proper character classes, such as Fighter, Black Mage, Viking, Shaman and others. Each job has different capabilities and can use different equipment. More powerful jobs become available later in the game. The characters can change jobs throughout the game, though it costs them "Capacity Points" (which are earned in battle). <br><br>The game itself is, like the previous games, a top-down RPG where your characters travel in the overworld, sometimes entering cities and dungeons to buy equipment, rest and fight random encounters and bosses with turn-based combat. <br><br>Some minor issues were slightly changed to resemble more the classical Final Fantasy look (such as the menu layout etc.).

The government alliance that had supported the building of ATLAS now find themselves facing economic crisis as the balance of power shifts. In this world of conflict and change, the Walking Panzer, or Wanzer, (a form of mecha) becomes the standard armored unit for wars and petty battles across the globe. For the small nation of Bergen, a coup d'etat is underway, staged by Colonel Ark. Seeking to establish complete control over the government and the NORAD units stationed there, Ark's first step involves the capture of President Orwen. Tipped off to the rebellion, Orwen seeks to flee from Bergen, looking for safe passage out of the seaport of Port Ertothal. A young Wanzer pilot, Albert Grabner, is assigned escort duty to the president by loyal elements of the army stationed there...<br><br>Gun Hazard is a side-scrolling version of the Front Mission series.

Essential components include the Booster ability which allows the wanzer to hover and increase it's jumps, as well as the Dash ability which allows quick left-right movement by the wanzer.

The player chooses one of the four available hovercars and then can race with other hovercars in one of the gameplay modes - "Practice" or "Grand Prix". <br><br>In "Practice" mode, the player chooses one track where he competes with one other hovercar to win the race (or there can be no rival at all, if you so wish). In "Grand Prix", the player must complete a series of races with several competitors. Each race consists of five laps. <br><br>The hovercar has a limited Power meter, which represents the machine's health and decreases when the hovercar collides with the track boundaries and other players. If power runs out, the hovercar explodes and the player loses the race. There are repair areas near the start line, which restore power to the player's hovercar if he drives into them. The tracks contain many more or less dangerous traps, such as icefields or landmines. <br><br>Completing a lap awards the player a "Super Jet" which can be activated at any time to give a short speed boost.

Description=An official sequel to the two Ghostbusters movies, Ghostbusters: The Video Game puts the player in control of Rookie, the unnamed newest member of the Ghostbusters. Shortly after being hired a mysterious ghostly shock wave flows through New York City, prompting the Ghostbusters to begin an investigation. Over the course of the game they will return to many locations from the movies and meet returning characters as well as some new locations and characters.<br><br>As the Rookie the player must explore levels to find and capture any ghosts while being assisted by fellow Ghostbusters following you. A ghost must first be weakened using any of the proton pack weapon modes it is vulnerable to, then by dragging the stunned ghost to a trap placed by the player or their teammates. Other enemy types must be defeated by first revealing a weak point and then pulling it out with the proton pack's blast stream, or by simply dealing enough damage to the enemy. If the Rookie takes too much damage themselves they will be knocked unconscious, and their allies will attempt to get to them and help them back up. The Rookie can do the same if any of their allies are knocked unconscious, and if all current members of the team are knocked down the game will return to the last checkpoint. Information about enemies and objects in the world can be obtained by scanning them, and concept art for the entries can be added by finding hidden pages in the levels. The Rookie receives upgrades to their proton pack automatically over the course of the game, and by finding enough scanner entries they can increase their health.<br><br>Ghostbusters: The Video Game on the Wii and PS2 shares the same story, level settings, and most of the dialogue of the XBOX360/PS3/Windows version, but it also has several departures. Levels are condensed, redesigned, and occasionally completely removed. The art assets were changed to a cartoon-like style, and some bosses were redesigned as a result. While this version lacks an online mode, the Wii release does allow two players to play through story mode in co-op, something impossible in the high definition version. Finally the player has the option of playing a female Rookie, although this has no impact on the story (and some characters still refer to the Rookie as being male).

Description=The Golden Compass is an adaptation of the 2007 movie of the same, which in turn is based on the novel Northern Lights, the first in the His Dark Materials trilogy by British novelist Philip Pullman.<br><br>The game is set in a fantastical parallel universe where the soul of person resides out of the body and lives in the form of animals known as dæmons. The main character is Lyra Belacqua. Her best friend Roger is kidnapped by evil Gobblers and her uncle Lord Asriel is imprisoned when he discovers evidence that proves the existence of Dust particles, much to the dismay of the Magisterial representatives who rule the world as a dogmatic theocracy and do not allow people to contradict their doctrine. Lyra has to leave the safe haven that is Jordan College in Oxford to right the situation.<br><br>In typical 3rd-person action gameplay, Lyra needs to navigate the different environments. She excels at moving around with acrobatic actions and when enemies appear she relies on her wit, hiding behind objects or searching an escape route. When she is spotted, she can use one of the four collectibles to escape from a tricky situation. Health is represented as "courage" and a large extent of courage helps solving the puzzles. She can also play a Deception mini-game to outwit characters and gain additional courage.<br><br>Two other characters provide assistance her during her quest. The first is Pan, Lyra's dæmon and the manifestation of her spirit. Pan can transform into up to four different forms, gradually discovered during the quest. The basic Ermine form allows Pan to chew through ropes and reveals the areas where Lyra needs to solve puzzles or move around. The Sloth form introduces swinging to grab hold of branches or reach areas hard to access. The third form, Hawk, lets Lyra glide from great heights. She can also send out Pan in this form to retrieve objects at difficult locations. The final Wildcat form has Lyra slide down from special surfaces, climb nets and it provides a dash move to evade enemies.<br><br>Brute strength is represented by the second support character Iorek Byrnison, an armoured bear known as panserbjørne. He has most of the physical attacks. Next to health (replenished by bloodmoss) he has an armour gauge, filled up by gathering sky armour. Collected rage orbs fill up a rage meter, which introduces a special attack when maxed out. Pan is always by Lyra's side, while Iorek joins the party later in the game and he is not always present.<br><br>Lyra's journal stores her tasks, information about key locations and a section for the Alethiometer, the golden compass. It is a device that reveals the answer to any question when operated by a trained user. It contains four needles - three to construct a question and fourth for the answer. To ask questions and solve puzzles, Lyra needs to play the Divining game. It consists of three sessions where Lyra needs to match symbols to keep the focus (a circle of light) centred on the device, by pressing a key or button to spin a hand in a timely fashion. The meaning of the different symbols is revealed during the course of the game, by interacting with objects and characters. Conversations often introduce mini-games to keep the talking going.<br><br>Each of the characters can pick up objects that grant new abilities such as new forms, a slow spell, double damage or more insight into the workings of the Alethiometer.

Description=Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock is the third full game in the Guitar Hero series and fourth game overall. The gameplay remains similar to the previous games: using a guitar-shaped controller, you need to coordinate pressing the five fret buttons and strumming to the scrolling notes on screen. Missing notes will cause your performance meter to drop; if the meter drops too low then the performance is a failure and you will need to try again. This edition of the game features 71 new songs to play from various artists including Cream, The Rolling Stones, Black Sabbath, Aerosmith, Guns N' Roses, Santana, Sonic Youth, Weezer, and many more. In addition to the available songs the game also features &quot;boss battles&quot; against famous guitarists such as Slash, Tom Morello and Lou the Devil. Several game modes are available including career mode, co-op mode, and multiplayer mode. In addition to the main game modes, training and practice modes are available to aid in learning the game or figuring out a tricky passage in a song.<br><br>In career mode you play the part of a wanna-be rock star. Beginning with easier songs in small venues, you need to successfully complete tracks to make your way up to a superstar. Each venue you play requires a certain number of songs to be performed before you can move on to the next larger venue. Successful completion of songs also earns money which can be used to unlock characters, outfits, new guitars, and other bonuses.<br><br>The co-op career mode is similar to the single player variation, except two players work together (one on lead guitar, the other on bass or rhythm guitar) to complete songs. <br><br>The multiplayer game modes allow two players to compete against each other. In the Face-Off variation, two players take turns performing a song. The Pro Face-Off variation allows two players to compete at the same time playing the exact same note chart. Finally, in the battle mode each player can earn power ups by performing well which can be used to disrupt the other player.

Description=Guitar Hero: Metallica is the second game in the Guitar Hero series to focus on specific band, following the release of Guitar Hero: Aerosmith.<br><br>This title largely borrows from the novelties introduced in Guitar Hero: World Tour, with band career modes for single or multiple players with a storyline drawn as a cartoon, competitive modes online, and the possibility to play with different instruments such as a regular guitar, a bass guitar, drums, and doing the vocals. The storyline describes how a band wants to follow in the footsteps of the Metallica and become a leading act on their tour.

Description=Guitar Hero: World Tour is the fourth main game in the series and brings a major change to the concept. Following the release of Rock Band that built on the Guitar Hero concept but added additional instruments, World Tour introduces these as well to allow players to play together simultaneously as a real band. Next to the guitar that was the main peripheral for the previous titles, the bundled edition of the game adds a microphone for the vocal parts and drums for percussion. Just like the previous game, the guitar tracks are split up for the lead and bass. The lyrics and the vocal pitch is shown near the top of the screen, while the bottom part is split up for bass guitar, lead guitar and drums, each with a separate set of notes that need to be hit to correctly play the part.<br><br>While playing, a rock meter keeps track of successive notes hit (one for each player), which leads to score multipliers. When the meter becomes too low, other players can make up for this on a shared, general performance meter. In the same vein players share a star power meter, built up by playing through certain sections successfully, that any player can access.<br><br>There are four difficulty levels and a new beginner mode where notes are made as easy as possible to introduce the concept to new players. Most of the game content is centered around a Career mode (both Solo and Band) where players start a new band, choose an avatar an instrument, and then play different gigs unlocking new songs along the way. Completing tracks earns money that can be spent on outfits or instruments. There are once again encore songs and "boss challenges" where the lead guitar enters a duel. This is similar to the battles in Guitar Hero III, but without the power-ups. Instead it returns to a call-and-response mechanic similar to the Face-Off mode. Bands consists of offline players but online members can join as well. Complete bands can take on others online through the Battle of the Bands mode.<br><br>Through the Music Studio editor new songs can be composed and shared using the GHTunes service (not for the PS2). In this edition avatars can be customized with more detail using the Create-a-Rocker mode. Major artists have licensed their appearance in the game. The Wii version contains a Mii Freestyle mode where players can use their Mii characters in-game and compose songs through motions of the Wii remote and the Nunchuk controller.<br><br>There are several bundles for the game, based on the amount of instruments included, but also a stand-alone version as most of the versions are compatible with the controllers of previous games and even some of Rock Band.

If the player does not want to walk and search around, they have two ways to cut a corner: portraits, which are unlocked during the course of the game, can be used to teleport instantly to another place. Harry can also call a ghost which shows him the fastest way to the next mission. Exploration has mostly one goal: finding the 150 (more or less) hidden crests which unlock achievements and trophies. Because Harry lost his ability to jump and climb, he has to use spells to reach them.<br><br>Mini Games<br>The player will spend most of his time in three mini games: magic duels, brewing potions, and quidditch. The duels are used to learn new spells respectively improve the already known. Harry basically faces other magicians and uses his spells to defeat them, e.g. by paralyzing them or by parrying their spells. To perform a spell the player has to use his input device to recreate a certain movement.<br><br>Quidditch is a reaction test. Harry's broom flies automatically and the player can only slightly move it to fly through rings or avoid obstacles. While brewing potions Harry faces a bowl, ingredients and a time limit. Now he simply needs to recreate the receipt by using the ingredients in the correct on the bowl. Sometimes he needs to heat up the bowl or stir the brew up with his input device. If he makes a mistake there is smoke which costs time.

Description=HoopWorld is an action sports basketball game in arcade style where two teams of three face themselves in a match against each other to defend their home courts.<br><br>The goal of the game is to get the highest score by scoring baskets in a set amount of time. The player controls one team of three characters. He runs, passes the ball, fights, kicks, and punches characters of the opposing team, steals the ball from them, and performs dunks in order to win the match. These actions are performed with a Wii Remote and a Nunchuk controller. During a match so called Mystery Boxes will appear randomly on the court. Running over them will pick them up and reveal one of eight available power-ups that influence game play and enable players to protect their team or their basket with a shield, increase energy, or drain points from the opponents score.<br><br>The basketball courts are set in outdoor locations, such as a jungle, the inside of a volcano, a tropical island, a Greek village, a desert, and a dark forest. Each court has a two point, three point and a four point scoring zone, the further away from the opponents basket, the higher the points are when scoring a basket from distance. There are several teams the player can pick from, such as a Goth team, Samba Girls, Archaeologists, a Wild Western team, a group of Mercenaries, or Alien Robots. <br><br>HoopWorld can be played alone against the CPU, or together with a friend. There are three different game modes. The Quick Match allows a short session. In Tournament Mode the player plays through all available courts, and winning matches in Tournament Mode unlocks screens, teams and courts in Quick Match Mode. There is also a Survival Mode, which is an endless mode where the player keeps on playing until he loses. In this mode the AI gets increasingly more difficult. Once the player loses in this mode, his scores from all matches played in this session are accumulated, and the player can choose to upload this score to an online leader board. Next to three different game modes, there are four difficulty levels, that players can choose from. Those range from easy to crazy.

They can be customized to make them unique. Through training and winning tournaments statistics such as strength and speed can be improved.

Finding a job wasn't at all hard, and you soon find out why - you're the only nurse on call.<br><br>Gameplay is virtually identical in all platforms, being that the main differences between them come in the shape of rendered 3D visuals for the Wii and PC, while the DS sports pixel-art type 2D graphics. The music and much of the sound effects are also different between the handheld version and the others, a more bleepy old-school approach having been taken in the DS while the PC and Wii feature a more hi-definition approach. A few of the treatment machines also differ between the DS and the rest, but in the end the gameplay remains virtually the same, sporting no platform-specific mechanics.<br><br>Through a quick tutorial you learn the basics: patients must be taken to triage/diagnosis, and then different treatments will be in order using your DS stylus, Wii-mote or plain mouse.<br><br>Some patients demand more attention than others, and your limited equipment, when compared to the large and continuous flow of in-patients, means you have to juggle treatments, prescriptions and clean-up phases. An unchanged Quick Treatment bed means no other patients can use it, which can quickly lead to a high number of angry patients. If you let too many leave in wrath, then it's bye-bye money and try again (you are fired over and over, but they let you at it again since you're the only nurse available anyway).<br><br>Hysteria Hospital: Emergency Ward sports a casual atmosphere typical of Time Management games, something which is also reflected in the level of content and customisation available - add new sets of medical equipment to increase the number of patients you can treat; patients for which there is no treatment available can be sent to another center by means of an ambulance; buy items to keep in-patients happier for longer; and last but not least, change the color of your work uniform.<br><br>There isn't really much beyond this, and in the later, multi-floored levels you'll find yourself spending as much as you can in order to tend to the highest number of patients as humanly possible.<br><br>Then you become a legendary nurse.

Description=This is the first game of the series that conquered legions of fighter fans from all over the world. The King of Fighters '94 joins together fighters from other SNK Corporation franchises: Art of Fighting (Ryo Sakazaki, Robert Garcia, Takuma Sakazaki, Yuri Sakazaki, King), Fatal Fury (Terry Bogard, Andy Bogard, Joe Higashi, Mai Shiranui, Kim Kaphwan) and Ikari Warriors (Ralf Jones, Clark Steel, Heidern), as well as totally new fighters such as Kyo Kusanagi, Benimaru Nikaido, and Goro Daimon (from the Japanese team).<br><br>The King of Fighters '94 is notable in that it is one of the first known fighting games that pits a team of fighters against each other in single combat. Each team consists of three fighters for each player, the winner being the player who is able to eliminate the other team first. Each active character can charge up "Art of Fighting" style in order to gain access to "Desperation Moves", or "DMs" (moves which operate very much like Street Fighter's Super Combos). Playing against the computer, the player must defeat all 8 teams in the game in order to reach the final boss, Rugal Bernstein.

A young fairy called Ribbon takes the crystal and escapes to save it.  She lands in Dream Land, but pieces of the crystal have shattered and landed all across the world.  Kirby volunteers to help and together they go to find all the missing pieces.<br><br>Kirby will encounter his friends, who have been controlled by Dark Matter.

To properly finish the game, players must find all the hidden crystal shards tucked away in the various levels.  Only then will Kirby and his friends truly save Ripple Star.

Description=The Story:<br><br>The plot of Kirby's Epic Yarn largely revolves around Nintendo's cutesy cream-puff being dragged out of his normal world by an evil sorcerer named Yin-Yarn and trapped in a fabric-based world called Patch Land.  Everything in this new land, including the heroic marshmallow Kirby, are made of yarn and fabric.  As a result, Kirby has lost his signature inhalation and power absorption abilities.  After meeting and saving Fluff, a prince, Kirby and his companion decide to work together to "stitch-up" Patch Land in the wake of the destruction caused by Yin-Yarn.  <br><br>The Gameplay:<br><br>Kirby's Epic Yarn follows previous Nintendo franchises Paper Mario and Yoshi's Story in its creative design around physical real-life aesthetics.  Where Mario was designed around a flat paper theme, and Yoshi lived though a living story-book (in a sense, a variation on a paper theme), Kirby ventures into strange new territory being made of fabric and yarn.  Stages and puzzles are heavily designed around the fabric themes and aesthetics, such as enemies being made out of yarn, and puzzle elements involving zippers and buttons.<br><br>As mentioned, Kirby has lost his typical powers, and instead of using his formidable lungs as a weapon, he uses a whip (obviously) made of yarn.  While Kirby no longer swallows enemies to steal their powers, he hasn't slowed in the least bit where transformation and unique powers are concerned.  Kirby floats by transforming into a parachute, flies as a UFO, drives as a car, and features a wide range of other transformations including an anvil, a dolphin, a mole, a dune buggy, a rocket, a robot, musical notes, and more.<br><br>Like the Lego games or later Wario Land titles, Kirby really doesn't die.  However, taking damage causes Kirby to lose precious items (colored beads for instance) that the player collects throughout the levels to, in effect, earn higher scores, medals, and to unlock more challenges in the game.  As well as the item collection, each stage contains three hidden secrets for players to hunt.  Each "world" in the game features a boss battle and extra stages should the player meet the right challenges in item collection.  There are also new friends to be made who bring about several smaller challenges such as finding a certain number of characters in a stage within a time limit, carrying a character to a new location, and more.<br><br>Also, Kirby's Epic Yarn follows the seemingly current trend from Nintendo of the game playing largely as an old-school side-scrolling title a la New! Super Mario Bros, large segments of Metroid: Other M, and the revamped Donkey Kong Country Returns.  <br><br>Kirby also welcomes his new pal, Fluff, in two-player cooperative gameplay which adds to the puzzle solving and gameplay in many situations.  Like many Nintendo-helmed Wii games, Kirby's Epic Yarn takes liberties with the Wii Remote using it for several different styles of play--holding the Remote sideways a la classic controllers, pointing at the screen, or angling the controller for other uses.

Description=You play Kage, a skillful ninja in search of rescuing Princess Kiri from the hands of the warlord Yoshi.  Armed only with a sword and 'star knives', you must fight your way through countless henchmen and the occasional boss to complete your task.  Levels include the forest, moat, inside and outside of the castle.  These levels repeat as the seasons change.  The gameplay is side scrolling.  Kage's moves include the ability jump extremely high in the air, grab and climb trees, block and attack with his sword, and throw shuriken.  The game can be challenging at times though because the player dies in one hit.  2-players are supported, but must take turns.

Description=Spyro wakes up late one night to discover that his rescued friend, Cynder, is running away from the temple where they live.  Spyro (and reluctantly, his friend Sparx) chase after her.  Little do they know that they are in for another adventure, where they will meet the mysterious Chronicler and eventually face off against Gaul, the Ape King.<br><br>The Legend of Spyro: The Eternal Night is a 3D action platformer which takes place right after the events at the end of The Legend of Spyro: A New Beginning.  Players control Spyro as he searches for his friend Cynder.  Initially, he has lost all of his different breath powers from the first game, but he gradually recovers the ability to breathe fire, ice, earth and electricity.  New to this game is the ability for Spyro to slow down time using his newly-learned 'Dragon Time' ability.<br><br>While the game has some basic puzzles involving pressing switches, the main focus is still around fighting.  Spryo's primary attack is his headbutt, but he can also use his assorted breaths to defeat foes provided that he has enough magic power.  He also earns blue gems from defeating foes which will allow him to level up his powers.

Description=Goemon (Kid Ying) and Ebisu-Maru (Dr. Yang) are enjoying themselves at home, when they hear about strange spirits sighted at the temple and taking control of the other villagers. Concerned, that a new evil has appeared, the two set out to confront it at the temple. This is just the beginning of a new adventure that will take them Goemon and his partner all across Japan; into moutain villages, amusement parks, castle fortresses and more!<br><br>Players control either Goemon or his partner Ebisu-Maru (or both, in 2 player mode). They sequentially travel through adventure-type villages and side-scrolling jump and run action stages. In the overhead-view villages, enemies must be defeated in order to earn money and other items (which include a weapon-enhancing lucky cat and mystical scrolls). The player is able to attack with their primary weapon and jump. Throwing weapons can also be used, which consume money for each one thrown. Attacking innocent villagers will cause the player to lose money. Money can also be gained (or lost) by visiting one of the numerous mini games, often in houses: which include mazes, whack-a-mole, the lottery, dice, a 3D labyrinth and a game trivia quiz show. Other businesses such as shops, resturants, inns and judo training can also be visited.<br><br>At the end of each village is an &quot;action area&quot; which changes the game in a complete side-scroller. One or both players can enter this place, filled with obstacles, traps, enemies and a boss creature. In addition to the regular moves used in town, players also gain the ability to unleash one of four special attacks for each character (if bought beforehand at the judo training center). These consume the scrolls collected in order to use. Additionally, in a 2 player game, characters can ride piggy-back on one another, to avoid getting stuck by a scrolling screen.

Description=Legend of Xanadu II continues the story of the  first game. Once again, the player controls the adventurer Areios, who emerged victorious after the final battle in the end of the first game. Together with his friend Daimos, Areios is looking for their other friend, who has disappeared. On the way, their ship is attacked by the evil Dragon Riders. It seems the search won't be as easy as they have thought, as Areios gets involved in a dangerous adventure again...<br><br>The sequel is very similar to the first game gameplay-wise. The player explores towns, vast outdoor areas, and dungeons, engaging enemies in real-time combat. Damage is inflicted upon the enemies simply by running into them, without any special attack button. There are various weapons to equip, and they level up in proficiency the more the player uses them. Areios gains additional hit points depending on the damage he receives. Party members help him in battles, controlled by the AI.<br><br>Like in the previous games, there are side-scrolling segments which lead to boss battles at the end of each chapter. Bosses must be fought using conventional action gameplay, attacking by pressing a button and jumping to avoid their attacks.

Of course, soon Areios finds himself involved in a battle against sinister forces, and commences the longest and most dangerous adventure of his life!<br><br>The game is an action RPG set in the Dragon Slayer universe, with a gameplay style similar to  Falcom's other popular series, Ys. Controlling Areios, the player explores the top-down world, visiting towns and fighting monsters in vast outdoor areas and dungeons. Like in Ys series, it is sufficient to "bump" into a monster in order to inflict damage. Areios gains hit points and becomes stronger by sustaining damage from enemies and resting. His weapons and armor can gain experience and level up. In many areas, companions will join Areios and help him in combat, controlled by the computer AI.<br><br>The game is divided into chapters; the final stage of each chapter is a side-scrolling/platform level, which Areios has to navigate in order to reach the boss enemy, defeat him, and end the chapter. In such stages, the combat turns into a more familiar action-oriented style, with the player being required to press buttons in time in order to execute attacks and jump.<br><br>There is a day/night cycle in the game, manifested not only in graphical changes, but also in the schedules of townspeople: when it's dark, people will return to their homes and go to sleep, etc.

Description=Recently, famine and drought have plagued Hyrule.  When all seemed lost, a mysterious wizard, Agahnim, appeared, and stopped these strange happenings from occurring.  But there is talk that Agahnim now rules the country with his magic, behind the scenes.  And then, one night, the Princess of Hyrule, Zelda, calls out for help...and the one who hears her pleas is a young lad named Link...<br><br>The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past is a top-down action adventure game (similar to the original Legend of Zelda) for the Super Nintendo and Game Boy Advance.  Players assume the role of Link, and their goal is to rescue Princess Zelda and save the land of Hyrule.  Unlike turn-based RPGs, all combat in Link to the Past is in real-time - you swing your sword at enemies by pressing a button, or can spin the sword around you for a more powerful attack by holding down the button until it is charged.<br><br>Progression through the game is done by conquering a series of dungeons - each dungeon has its own special item associated with it, such as the hookshot (which latches onto a far-off object and pulls Link across) or the hammer (which can be used to flatten objects in your way).  Most of these dungeons are rendered impassable until the dungeon's particular item is acquired; from there, the rest of the dungeon becomes accessible due to Link's latest new ability.  The bosses of each dungeon are also themed to that level's particular item.<br><br>Link starts out with only three units of health; however, these can be increased by defeating dungeon bosses, which give one additional heart container, or by finding four 'pieces of heart'; which can be given for anything from passing a small trial to winning a mini-game.  Some of Link's items also use magic - this can be refilled with collectible green magic pots.  After defeating the initial three dungeons, Link gains access to the Dark World - many puzzles and difficulties come from alternating between the Light World (Hyrule) and the Dark World to make your way past previously impassable obstacles.<br><br>The Game Boy Advance version of the game also includes a special extra dungeon.  In addition to this, there is the first multiplayer Zelda game ever: Four Swords.  In this game puzzles are based around co-operation with other players - for example, picking up an enemy and throwing it at another player which allows its weak point to be hit, or a boss which only shows the weak point you can hit on an opponent's screen.  However, the game also contains an element of competitiveness - whoever gains the most rupees at the end of the level wins a bonus medal.  Collect enough of these and you can unlock a special quest in A Link to the Past.

It is up to Link to save the day again.<br><br>Time travel and mask hunting take a bigger chunk out of the quest compared to the last Zelda. Although there are only three days to complete the game, the player is able to travel back in time after finding the  Ocarina. Any items that were found and any quests that were  completed are either saved or lost, depending on importance.

Description=In one of the darkest times in the Kingdom of Hyrule, a young, pointy-eared boy named Link takes on an epic quest to restore the fragmented Triforce of Wisdom and save the Princess Zelda from the clutches of the evil, power-hungry Ganon.<br><br>The Legend of Zelda for the NES marks the first action-adventure title of the popular Nintendo series. Players must make their way through the various forests, graveyards, plains, and deserts of the Overworld to find the secret entrances of the eight dungeons in an attempt to piece together the broken Triforce. Once all pieces are joined, Link will be able to gain entry to Death Mountain, home of Ganon, and prison of Princess Zelda.<br><br>The game is drawn in a top-down perspective. Link begins his quest in the Overworld, which features forests, mountains and lakes and is divided into several screens. Link can explore the Overworld freely, though when he enters a screen, he will encounter several enemies. He can attack them with his sword. If link is at full health, he can toss his sword to attack enemies from afar, but when he is hurt, even slightly, he can only fight in melee range. <br><br>Link's health is represented by hearts; initially he can have a maximum of three hearts, but as he progresses in the game, he will find heart containers that increase his maximum health. The enemies are varied - some attack from up close, some shoot projectiles. When killed, they often leave behind an item - a heart to restore energy, rupees that function as money (and can be used to buy stuff in various shops in the Overworld), or bombs which can be picked up and set down to attack enemies or destroy some walls. When enemies are killed, they stay dead and will not re-appear once the screen is entered again. <br><br>There are other items to find in the game; some function as weapons, while others are used to solve puzzles. <br><br>To find the Triforce pieces, Link must explore dungeons. Once he finds an entrance to the dungeon and goes in, he must explore the rooms, fight enemies and collect keys until he finds the boss monster he must defeat. He will then be able to pick up a Triforce piece. Once he does so, however, all the monsters in the Overworld come back to life. <br><br>If Link dies on his quest, he can continue it; he will go back to his start position in the Overworld, but with the items he managed to collect so far. When Link finishes his quest, the pl;ayer can choose to play the "2nd quest", which is essentially a harder version of the game. <br><br>The Legend of Zelda is known for several factors that were revolutionary at the time: A full world that could be freely explored, power-ups that would permanently enhance your character's abilities, and a battery back-up save feature that allowed players to retain their progress instead of having to start over. The gameplay balanced out frequent action sequences with discovery, secrets, and exploration.

The beast can also dig holes to find hearts and rupees and to get in places. He can push blocks with his head to climb higher or reveal hidden passageways. Additionally, he can attack enemies by biting or pouncing on them.<br><br>As a human, Link can move around quickly, aim his bow, swing his sword, and even fish. Link also collects many different items, which allow him to perform varied attacks and reach places he couldn't before.

Chronologically, the game takes place between the two aforementioned titles and quite a few locations from Ocarina of Time can be visited. The main adventure takes place in several provinces with dungeons and temples. With the help of Midna, you can easily travel around quickly later in the game.

Your travels will go all over France, from the Count's castle to a picturesque village in Normandy.<br><br>The Three Musketeers is a traditional platform game using a side scrolling 3D engine similar to Duke Nukem: Manhatthan Project. Typically for a platform game, The Three Musketeers has its fair share of moving platforms and obstacles. These come in many flavours, from wine barrels rolling down a hill towards you, to axes chopping everything that comes in their way. Most enemies you meet are soldiers that you have to defeat in a swords duel, but you will also come across archers and creatures such as spiders. The controls are simple. You use one button to jump and one to strike with your trusted sword. The game contains 10 levels in total, and between each level the story is forwarded with cartoon-like cut-scenes.

Description=Continuing the tradition of adapting known franchises such as Star Wars and Indiana Jones with visuals based on LEGO, this game takes on the Batman universe. The basic concept is the same, with characters and objects built up using LEGO blocks, but here shown against surroundings drawn in a regular fashion. Most of the environments are side-scrolling with a fixed camera perspective, but in 3D with quite some depth. <br><br>It is not based on a certain movie or comic, but on the franchise as a whole with a new story. The animations and sequences are rather quirky and share nothing with the darker atmosphere of the contemporary Batman movies. A cast of villains has escaped from Arkham Asylum and now roam through Gotham City wreaking havoc. The first half of the game, players control Batman and his sidekick Robin to take on all enemies with typical brawler gameplay. Enemies will often respawn endlessly until the player figures out how to progress. The environments can be explored using a number of gadgets such as the batarang and the grappling hook, and players can switch between the two characters at any time. They can both fight and the inactive character is always controlled by the computer AI. Both characters have unique powers they can access by changing their suits. Batman can then glide through the air or plant bombs, while Robin has for instance a technology suit that allows his to walk on metal surfaces in any direction. They can also drive certain vehicles.<br><br>Both characters operate out of the Batcave that acts as a central hub to store trophies and access missions. Many of the missions have small puzzle elements with buttons or passages that need to be cleared. Objects and characters explode into smaller LEGO blocks and at certain sections the hero need to build structures with blocks to create new objects. After completing a mission in the story mode, it becomes available in a separate free play mode.<br><br>In the second part of the game players take control of the different villains such as Poison Ivy, The Joker, Mr Freeze, The Riddler, Killer Moth, Hush, Clayface, Man-Bat and more. They all have different powers and their section of the game always ends at the moment they are confronted by Batman and Robin. This way, the game shows how they set up their plans prior to the fights in the first part of the game. The characters collect coins, objects and hearts. Even though they can die, they immediately respawn.<br><br>Multi player options vary between platforms. Home console and Windows versions allow drop in/drop out co-op. The PSP release fares worst of all and does not contain any kind of multiplayer option.

Description=LEGO Harry Potter: Years 1-4 is the first installment of the Harry Potter series in LEGO form. Spanning the first four years of the Harry Potter franchise, players take control of a wide variety of characters and relive famous moments from the first four books; Sorcerer's Stone, Chamber of Secrets, Prisoner of Azkaban, and Goblet of Fire. Almost all of the game takes place inside Hogwarts.<br><br>The Story mode is broken up into four years with six chapter per year. When you first play story mode you are required to play as certain characters that are part of that story and you cannot choose any character from the entire series. But once you beat that chapter a Free Mode is unlocked, allowing you to pick any unlocked character and replay that story. All story chapters and years can be accessed in The Leaky Cauldron which acts as the central hub in the game. The entire environment allows for continuous play and most places can be revisited at any time. Many of the characters' interactions change however based on the time of year, or when certain characters are introduced such as the Dementors or Gilderoy Lockhart.<br><br>Outside of The Leaky Cauldron is Diagon Alley. In Diagon Alley you can head to other stores to obtain items and supplies. At Madam Malkin's Robes you can spend all of your hard earned studs (the currency) to buy new characters. At Eeylops Eye Emporium you can head upstairs and buy Red Bricks which contain cheat codes of sorts to use. And at Wiseacre's Wizarding Supplies you can buy fun new spells to cast on anybody you like. Casting spells is an important part of the gameplay and is accessed by a spell wheel in which you can choose many ranging from Wingardium Leviosa to the dreaded Aveda Kedavra (only the three versions of Voldemort can use this).<br><br>LEGO Harry Potter adds to the replay value by having a bunch of collectibles for you to obtain. If you want to get 100% completion you're going to have to do things such as find and purchase all 167 characters, rescue 50 students in peril, find 200 gold bricks, and much more. Hogwarts school is open to you at all time where you can search the many rooms and floors for all these collectibles. You will have to wait though if you try to get everything early because many characters have their own special abilities pertaining to them.<br><br>There is no online multiplayer in LEGO Harry Potter but there is co-op. At any time another person can join you in the action, played on a single screen. Similar to LEGO Indiana Jones 2: The Adventure Continues, when one character goes off screen, it is split automatically and the game goes on that way until they are close again.

Description=In LEGO Indiana Jones 2: The Adventure Continues the players once again explore the Indiana Jones universe with "LEGO-fied" characters. This time the main part of the game focuses on the events of the fourth film of the series called Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull with three campaigns retelling the story in a humorous, light-hearted way similar to the other games from the LEGO series. The other three campaigns on the other hand once again turn their focus on the original three films but with different scenes and levels that can't be found in the first game.<br><br>The game itself is a third-person platform/action game where the players take control over various heroes including Indiana Jones and side-characters which mostly don't have any real name. Again each character has has different abilities, fears and weapons. While Indiana Jones has his whip to pull items out of reach or constrain enemies with, his son Mutt is a very good repairman. The characters also have different phobias (snakes, rats, spiders), each corresponding to their personalities.<br><br>Instead of providing a central hub which the characters return after each mission, this time around not only the story moves forward but also the locations. So while the game starts out at the University campus and uses it as the main hub, it eventually moves over to the dig-site in South America. After each successful mission a new part of the hub is unlocked mostly through unlocking new characters or vehicles that allow the player to get to previously unreachable territory. Since these hubs are very big, a great amount of vehicles is available to unlock the same way other characters are unlocked: finding them in the hub and paying studs for them. Studs are again collected by destroying scenery objects, building stuff and such. To that end each level again holds a great amount of secret for which different characters are needed to unlock them requiring several playthroughs of the same level to find all bonus items and complete the game 100%.<br><br>The game once again features an editor to create unique heroes from parts. In addition a level editor is now available where the player walks around the map spawning the items he needs and putting them in place with his character. The two-player co-op mode also makes his return allowing two players to play through the whole game. The second player can enter the game at any given time by pressing a button on the second controller. As opposed to the previous games, the players aren't restricted to the same area anymore. Instead they now both can move freely around. Once a character leaves the screen of the other, the view gets divided with the placement of each character-view changing all the time depending on which direction the corresponding player is moving in relation to the center of the level.

The characters also have different phobias (snakes, rats, spiders), each corresponding to their personalities.<br><br>The main campaign of the game is called Story Mode in which the player follows the film's stories with two pre-defined characters and cut-scenes. Once the level has been cleared, however, the player can return in Free Play mode and switch between all the characters that have been unlocked, allowing access to previously unreachable areas to collect all other artifacts and bonus items.<br><br>Destroying or building objects produces Lego studs, which allows the player to buy additional characters and cheat modes in Barnett College (the main hub). Players can also watch previous cut-scenes, examine previously found treasures, enter codes, or explore the college at their leisure.<br><br>As in the LEGO Star Wars series, in addition to the single-player game, there is also a 2 player co-op mode that allows two players to play the Story Mode. The second player can enter the game at any given time by pressing a button on the second controller.

Description=MadWorld is a stylish action beat-em up game, that puts player in the role of a police detective gone rogue and taking part in a violent TV show, in which contestants are encouraged to mutilate each other in increasingly violent and gruesome ways. <br><br>The game's unique presentation is achieved through a three-colour palette scheme. All the environments, objects and characters are rendered in black and white, as if drawn in a comic book. The only other colour present is red, which accounts for the gallons of blood flowing from the victims of Jack, the game's protagonist. Aside from being inspired by comic books, MadWorld's presentation is also taking hints from the competitive TV shows, with two over-enthusiastic hosts commenting every event happening in the game. <br><br>The core of the MadWorld experience is a series of challenges, player must take part in. Each challenge presents a confined arena, in which player should score points by defeating his enemies in the most elaborate way possible and take part in the so-called Bloodbath-Challenges, which present additional rules and timed mini-games (like ManDarts or ManGolf) for racking up the points. Once a sufficient amount of points was met, players must fight a unique boss enemy for the current challenge. When boss is defeated, the player will be free to proceed to the next challenge. <br><br>The game also features a heavy use of quick time events in conjuncture with Wii motion-sensitive controls for the finishing moves, mini-games and general tasks, such as avoiding being hit by the enemy.

Description=Major League Baseball 2K9 is a simulation of the sport of baseball. The heart of the game is the franchise mode where the player can play whole seasons with its hundreds of matches and a managerial part. Besides keeping the balance, there are three main activities in this part: studying extensive statistics, player trading and hiring players through free agents. The latter is similar to other sports games: every player has other wishes for his team, e.g. athletic success. If the player's club can fulfill these wishes better the club has to pay less salary. Trading however is handled differently: Every club gives a value to the players on the roster. This value influences how the trading plays out. Training is another important part to consider.<br><br>Matches can either be simulated or played manually. Every part of the match has its own control scheme: For pitching the player uses two parts of his input device: the first for aiming and the second to recreate a movement (depending on the used move). Batting is done by swinging the bat in the right timing. He can also influence the ball's direction in the way he hits it. During fielding the player basically tells the controlled player the direction in which he should throw the ball. <br>Besides the franchise mode the player can participate in training, Home Run Derby and Postseason mode (play-offs). Players can unlock training cards.<br><br>The are a few small differences between the versions: on the Wii the player controls batting and pitching directly with the remote and the nunchuck and the PSP version features slightly different fielding controls. In the franchise mode the player can manage up to four franchises in the PS2 version and there is a farming system on PSP.

Description=Manhunt 2 does not build upon the story and events of the first game. Instead, the same game mechanics are transferred to a new location, the Dixmor Insane Asylum, where the staff prefers to beat up the patients and experiment on them, rather than to offer treatment for their illness. One day a power outage allows the patients to revolt and bring mayhem to the asylum. The player gets the chance to play two roles: as Dr. Daniel Lamb and Leo Kasper. Although the beginning is set inside the asylum, the action soon moves to other locations.<br><br>The game mechanics are largely stealth oriented, while later levels offer more of a regular third-person shooter feel when more firearms become available. Gunplay requires extensive use of cover, maneuvers and sometimes stealth for success. There is a radar system, enemies have different levels of awareness and kills are best performed from the shadows. Players can throw objects to distract enemies or make noises into the USB headset to lure them away from their friends (PS2). To hide in the dark a quick mini-game needs to be performed. If it is not completed in time, the character's location will be revealed at once.<br><br>As in the first game players can perform executions, with three styles: Hasty (white), Violent (yellow) and Gruesome (red). These feature explicit violence including strangling, beatings, gun violence, setting them on fire and more. Some of these kills are however censored with blacked out scenes or the camera turning away. In the Wii version player need to mimic the motions needed for a kill with the combination of the Wiimote and the Nunchuk.<br><br>All versions are quite similar. The Wii edition includes three exclusive weapons (bottle, mace and a razor), while the other two versions have a weapon not found in the Wii game: a samurai sword. The Wii version is also the only one to include a short tutorial to familiarize the player with the controls. Other small changes in the Wii edition include more detailed environments, additional dialogue, new hunters (Sexual Deviants scene), some changes in weapon placement, a new manhole execution (in Ghosts), and more animations for Daniel and Leo, especially in close combat.

Description=Mario Kart 64 races eight familiar faces, including Mario, Bowser and Yoshi, on four progressively tougher four-track circuits. Wide curves and gentle banks mark the Mushroom Cup tracks. Your commute gets notably tougher on the Flower Cup, though. The player will have to dodge semis rumbling on Toad's Turnpike and bounding boulders on fogbound Choco Mountain! Star Cup tracks range from the icy surfaces of Sherbet Land to the lava lakes of Bowser's Castle. The true test of karting competence, though, comes on the four tracks in Special Cup. Zip through the dark caves and green hillsides of Donkey Kong's Jungle Parkway, cling to the sheer cliffs of Yoshi Valley and hustle over haunted Banshee Boardwalk before tackling the longest track in the game: neon-lit Rainbow Road. <br><br>The game offers two camera angles and three engine sizes: 50cc, 100cc and 150cc. You can gain even more speed by mastering the power slide technique or grabbing Super Star power-ups. Each kart has distinctive handling, acceleration and top speed capabilities. Light karts like Princess's smoothly steer through tight corners, but run the constant risk of getting flattened by heavy karts, like Donkey Kong's. Shells that you fire at rival racers, Bananas that make them skid out and Lightning Bolts that make them small and very slow are just a few of the game's unique power-ups.

Certain teams such as The Fantastic Four and The New Avengers provide additional bonuses.<br><br>Some heroes must be unlocked first. The game also features RPG elements, such as leveling up. When a hero gains a level, they earn points you can use to upgrade their skills. You also collect Shield Coins, which can be spent on boosts for your hero team. <br><br>You explore various legendary Marvel locales, from Asgard, to Prince Namor's Atlantis, where you take on foes with punches, kicks and super powers. Super powers drain energy, however, so use them wisely. Combos can be achieved by combining super powers. Energy is restored by collecting blue orbs from fallen foes. <br><br>Boss battles are like the comics themselves: titanic battles that often not only test brawn but your brain as well. With over 20 playable heroes plus all the cameos, there are over 100 heroes and villains.<br><br>The game modes feature either single player, co-op, or online play. In general, Marvel Ultimate Alliance's gameplay can be considered an improved version of 2004's X-Men: Legends. The different versions are fairly identical. The PSP release has three more game modes, while Wii, PS3 and Xbox 360 have additional levels.

Description=Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2 continues the four-player mayhem of the previous Marvel Ultimate Alliance and, before that, the X-Men Legends series It is based on the Secret War and Civil War storylines from the comics. After Nick Fury leads an unauthorized super-hero assault on Latveria and a fight gone wrong kills hundreds of civilians in Connecticut, the government passes the super-human registration act, which requires all super-powered individuals to reveal their identities to the government. At one point in the story, you have to choose the pro or anti registration side and certain heroes will always be on one side or another, locking them out if you choose the other path. The game after this point changes depending on the storyline you choose.<br><br>You start with a handful of characters and can unlock more by completing bonus simulator missions, which will give you a special task like blowing up cars. There are four heroes active at all times during the game, unless they get knocked out. Each character has a health meter and a stamina meter. You can use SHIELD access points, usually at the beginning and middle of each level, to switch out characters. The stamina meter recharges on its own and controls use of powers. Each hero has a jump (which can also be used to double-jump, fly or web-swing, depending on the character), grab, quick strike and powerful strike. These can be used in combination to do things like jumping attacks, pick up an enemy, then punch them, etc. Combining these with a modifier button allows you to use powers. Each hero has a wide variety of powers. Leveling up gives you points to spend on improving the powers. You can re-assign the points and change which powers are active at any time.<br><br>Defeating enemies and smashing environment items gives you health refills and points that can be spent upgrading statistics for each hero. There are also items that you can carry that will give stat bonuses like increased HP or a bonus to a specific type of damage.<br><br>The big change over the previous game is the addition of fusions, which are two-character team-up attacks. This is controlled by a meter of four stars. You fill this by defeating enemies or finding an item that instantly fills the whole meter. You can spend one star to revive a fallen teammate or all four to perform a fusion attack. Any possible combination of two characters has their own unique fusion. There are three basic types:<br><br>There are targeted fusions, like having Things throw Mr. Fantastic at someone. These do high damage to a single target and are good for using on bosses. There are also clearing fusions, like having Storm bounce her lighting off Wolverine. These damage all enemies in a given radius. Clearing fusions are good for clearing out a clump of enemies. Finally, there are guided fusions, like Iceman and Human Torch shooting their powers at each other, then running around mowing down anyone who gets between them. These are good for clearing out scattered enemies.

Description=Max & the Magic Marker is a physics based 2D puzzle platformer where the player needs to solve puzzles by drawing into the environment, forming physical objects that can be used to overcome puzzles. The game's protagonist is Max, a young boy who receives an envelope with a marker inside. He draws a monster, Mustacho, but suddenly the character comes to life and disappears into Max' drawings. Max chases after him and needs to travel through different worlds to halt the villain.<br><br>Max is able to run around, jump, push and pull objects, and climb up or slide down. At the same time the player controls a large marker on the screen. To use it, it needs to be filled with ink, which is collected through bubbles scattered around the level. At certain passages Mustacho often appears to vacuum all the ink out of the marker. Using the orange marker the player can draw lines and shapes into the environment to form objects. The possibilities are determined based on the amount of ink available and quick swipes use less ink compared to drawing slowly. Using the marker the player can draw steps, bridges and platforms to help out Max. More complex shapes are also possible, include shields, objects to drop down on enemies or to use seesaw mechanics; offering different possibilities to solve puzzles. Different objects can exist next to each other and independent lines can be connected to form complex shapes. At any time the used ink can be reclaimed to start over. When the objects are out of view the marker can be shaken to retrieve all of it.<br><br>There are different worlds to explore, each with a unique theme, and every world consists of multiple levels with checkpoints. At any time the player can swap between Max' imagination and the original drawings. In the original drawing mode the graphics change and time is halted. The latter is also used as a game mechanism to pause the game and draw objects without time constraints. Next to the ink each level also holds a number of secret items and gel bubbles. Max is vulnerable against most dangers, such as enemies and especially water or rain.<br><br>Collected objects open up additional play modes and secrets.

Mayhem decides to change it back, with the help of Theo Saurus, the apprentice responsible for Monsterland being the gloomy place it is now.<br><br>The game is a side-scrolling platform game, where you play the part of Mayhem.  You can kill enemies by jumping on them.<br><br>There are five levels in the game.  Each one starts in unhappy mode, where Mayhem must collect enough bags of magic dust, from the enemies you face, then find your way to Theo's hidden cave.  Theo then uses the dust to make the level happy again.  This change is reflected in the more jazzy music, colourful landscape and even the monsters who look more friendly and cheerful.<br><br>Some of the magic, however, clumps together into magical stars, that Mayhem must collect, on the happy version of the level, to stop them falling into the wrong hands.  There is a quota of stars that Mayhem must collect, before going over the finishing line. <br><br>In the happy version of the level there are more bonuses that can be collected, such as score multipliers, extra lives, extra time, etc.  The most important is probably the ability to charge, allowing Mayhem to run very fast, killing any enemies in his way.

He needs to get behind enemy lines and prevent Hitler from deploying the V2 rocket, with the help of US troopers. The story is told through briefings with still voices and narrated voice-overs.<br><br>Next to the classic first-person shooting gameplay true to the series, the Wii version offers a new, more accessible mode with on-rails shooting - the computer handles the movement while players only need to aim and shoot. In the regular mode, players move around with the analog stick, look around with the Wii remote, lean with the Nunchuk and fire with the B-button, a departure from the control system introduced in Medal of Honor: Vanguard. The game also offers a lock-on system with the Z-button. Alternately, players can use the Wii Zapper to aim and shoot.<br><br>The regular combat remains, but much more events have been added with a few mini-games thrown in. For instance, players need to twist the Wii remote to tune a radio for mid-game incoming information and the sound comes through the remote's speaker. Other quirks require the player to raise the Nunchuk to pump the shotgun. Players need to plant charges (twist the Wii remote like a timer), pick up documents and man various stationary guns. This version also marks the return of the sniper rifle and adds bazookas and mortars.<br><br>Up to 32 players can simultaneously join a single match, with game modes such as Death Match, Team Death Match and Infiltration. Multiplayer maps are adaptations of the single-player levels.

Description=In the future city of Monsteropolis, the use of robot labour has helped civilization grow more than ever before. At the forefront of this technology is Dr. Light and his assistant Dr. Wily, who are commissioned to build six robots to handle a variety of specific tasks. They are named Bombman, Gutsman, Iceman, Cutman, Elecman, and Fireman in reference to their individual prime functions. Dr. Wily, however, has bigger plans and chooses to take control of the robots and let loose destruction in a bid for world control. Dr. Light fights back with the best tool he has, an experimental human-like robot, Rock aka Mega Man, who had been tested to perform cleaning duties. Now properly armed, it's up to Mega Man to take on the maverick robots, fight his way into Dr. Wily's castle, and end this madness.<br><br>Mega Man is a side-scrolling platformer. Mega Man has the ability to jump and fire his weapon. He must travel to the levels of the six robot masters and defeat them in combat. By doing so, Mega Man is able to acquire their power for his own. These powers can then be used interchangeably with his main weapon and target the weaknesses of specific enemy bosses. Additionally, some hidden areas of the levels can only be accessed by using certain captured robot weapons. A special  Magnet Beam ability can also be found which can be used to create steps. <br><br>Travelling throughout these levels, Mega Man is confronted by an army of lesser robot creations. Destroying these usually yields energy capsules (for refilling Mega Man's Energy), weapon capsules (for refilling Mega Man's special robot weapons), and extra lives shaped like Mega Man's head.

It's quite similar, in all respects, to other Mega Man games; however, this is the first time that you get a sidekick. It's also the first time you're allowed to slide instead of merely walking. Also, there is a mysterious character called Protoman who may or may not be your friend.<br><br>Rush is your dog who helps out by offering other modes of transportation when you need it. He starts out with the 'Rush Coil' ability to launch you to the top of the screen like a springboard; later he acquires the 'Rush Jet' ability to turn into a guided, floating platform to carry you wherever you need to go; and he also gets the 'Rush Marine' ability which is a submarine that works just like the jet except underwater and with the added ability to hop around out of the water(you can actually jump while on the jet but the jet continues to hover beneath you whereas you stay inside the submarine). All of these abilities function just like boss weapons.<br><br>How do those work, you ask? When you defeat the boss at the end of a level you gain his power - or at least a similar power. You may pause the game at any time and switch to any single power you have. It supplants your regular Arm Cannon with a limited - but superior - ability. The weapon ammo is displayed next to your energy meter. There are 8 of these, corresponding to the 8 main levels, even though there are 21 levels in the entire game. The bosses are as follows: Snake Man, Gemini Man, Needle Man, Shadow Man, Spark Man, Top Man, Magnet Man, &amp; Hard Man.<br><br>Enemies will often supply you with both energy and ammo refills. You can also collect Energy Tanks which can only be used once but will entirely restore your health. You'll definitely want some of these for Dr. Wily's fortress, if not for the levels before it, since you start the game with only 3 lives. There are even Surprise Boxes lying around for you to find.

Description=The Antimatter Cold War has left Earth ruined as the stockpiled AM weapons of various nations were triggered in a chain effect, vaporizing large portions of the Earth. The once great continents have been drastically changed into thousands of tiny islands and various cities have washed into the oceans.  During this turmoil,  Zorgeuf the Great rushes to conquer the bewildered world along with a troop of commanders and declares the Earth Empire. The only hope to defeat him lies from without Earth, as the Colonial Forces send a command carrier from the major orbital base. With so many armies gone, the ground infantry unit has been replaced by the Metal Marine, a fifty foot armored robot that can be sent into battle for attack or defense. From their respective Command Center, each side in the conflict will need to direct the placement of facilities on the ground to defend against enemy attack, manage resources and successfully strike the enemy.<br><br>Metal Marines is an isometric strategy game. Controlling one side of a conflict, the player must wage a campaign across several islands to defeat Zorgeuf and his lieutenants. The player controls logistics of the base to ensure that there are the necessary assets to wage war. On each map, the player places three underground command bases, if all of these are destroyed the battle is lost.  The player must manage the resources of their money to construct new buildings or upgrade existing facilities on the map. Different buildings include Energy Plants, Factories, Economic Centers, Radar systems, Anti-Aircraft missiles, fake buildings and fake HQ bases, mine fields, gun pods, missile launchers, metal marine hangers and even ICBMs.  At any time, the player may order an attack and choose which assets to fire at the opponent. Missiles, Metal Marines carriers and ICBMs all use different levels of fuel. Metal Marines once deployed in an area will automatically fire rifles at nearby targets or engage even closer targets in melee attacks. Gunpods, while stationary, will also fire on nearby enemies. Metal Marines are largely autonomous but can be manually controlled to a minor degree (directional) by the player.

Description=Metoid: Other M follows recent console releases of Metroid games by being developed, like the Metroid Prime trilogy, by a studio outside of Nintendo.  This time, rather than being handed to what, at the time, was a rookie studio, Metriod: Other M has been developed by veteran developer Team Ninja, notable for Dead or Alive and the Ninja Gaiden series.<br><br>Other M takes place, chronologically, after the events of Super Metroid, and before the events of Metroid Fusion.  After a recuperation introduction, and a cinematic retelling of the final moments of Super Metroid, the game begins with Samus intercepting and investigating a distress call.  The call comes from a space station (much like Metroid Fusion) that is in trouble.  Samus meets up with her old military commander, Adam Malkovich and joins his team of Federation soldiers as they investigate the distressed station.  Per the gameplay story, Samus is largely considered to already have many of her suit's abilities (such as missiles and bombs) in tact, but doesn't use them until Adam gives the authorization.  <br><br>The game features a return to the side-scrolling gameplay of classic 2-D Metroid games, but in a hybrid form which also includes first-person shooter segments (utilized simply by pointing the Wii Remote at the television), and even 3rd-person over the shoulder segments for very small rooms.  Targeting enemies is typically just a matter of aiming in the right direction, and specific shots are automatic in 2-D mode.  In first-person mode, Samus can lock on to enemies to fire missiles.  The Morph Ball returns, as expected, and operates in a similar manner to the popular Metroid Prime titles, with the camera zoomed in extremely close in tight environments.  The over-the-shoulder 3rd-person view is mostly used for exploration of small rooms, and not combat.  The game is played using only the Wii Remote without the Nun-chuck accessory.<br><br>As a staple of the series, Samus can again build up her armaments and weapons by collecting items found by exploring the game.  This is in addition to the plot device that she doesn't use anything until authorized.<br><br>New to the franchise is ample use of cinematic cut-scenes, which are used to tell the back story of Samus, her past with Adam Malkovich, and her former military association.  Also, rare for a Nintendo title, is ample spoken dialog from the title character--both in cinematics and story sequences, as well as monologues detailing Samus' perceptions and feelings through the story.  <br><br>For the first time, Samus Arans overall agility is more in-line with her Super Smash Bros form than most previous Metroid titles and her combat catalog now includes finishing moves, dodges, and grapple attacks.  All the new moves are designed around simplicity and speed--sometimes operating automatically if the right button is held--and the games combat has the arcade-intense feel of Team Ninjas more recent Ninja Gaiden titles.<br><br>Pre-ordered copies of the game came bundled with an Art Folio containing sixteen cards featuring artwork from the game, with descriptions printed on the back.  The cards are roughly the same size and shape of a DVD case.

Description=Long ago, a bird-like race of creatures (called the Chozo) became extremely advanced technologically, but due to increasing violence in the universe, they began to hide and live more simple lives. The planet Tallon IV was the site of one of their colonies. Years later, a meteor crashed on Tallon IV releasing the strange element Phazon into the planet. Phazon poisoned anything it came in contact with, causing the plant and animal life to either die or mutate into a hideous form.<br><br>The Chozo tried to control the power of Phazon but failed. Before abandoning the planet, they were able to cover the impact crater with a temple and seal Phazon into the planets core. Now space pirates have discovered Tallon IV, moving in to study Phazon and harnessing its power. They have also began rebuilding their fortress on planet Zebes and reviving the Mother Brain, Ridley, and Kraid, all of whom were destroyed by Samus Aran. However, Samus has tracked the space pirates to Tallon IV and must now enter the planet to destroy them once and for all before they have a chance to rebuild their destructive forces...<br><br>Metroid Prime is a change from the platform-adventuring series, entering the first-person shooter genre for the first time. Players are now behind Samus Aran's visor and must use all their resources to investigate the pirate infestation of Tallon IV. Players can use Samus's beam, with missile and charge capabilities. Along the way, they must recover the bounty hunter's lost abilities like the morph ball and grapple beam, which allow them to reach unexplored areas of Tallon IV.  Players must piece together the story of the fallen Chozo to figure what has happened to the poisoned planet, and prevent the pirates from using the Phazon to wreak havoc throughout the planets.

Description=A long time ago a race of beings called the Luminoth settled the planet Aether. They built energy controllers to harness the "light of Aether" to prolong the life of their planet and its inhabitants. After many ages of peace and prosperity, a meteor collided with the planet; this collision opened a dimensional rift into another world, called Dark Aether. From this world came an evil race of beings known as the Ing, and for many ages a war was fought between the Ing of the dark world and the Luminoth of the light world. Over time the Ing began winning, turning the light world to dark. At about this time, a federation spacecraft happens to be chasing a Space Pirate vessel, which is destroyed by the Ing, through the area. Wondering about the fate of this craft, the Galactic Federation sends an urgent message to Samus Aran, asking her to find the crew and investigate the planet Aether.<br><br>This is the sequel to Metroid Prime where players once again control bounty hunter Samus Aran as she arrives on Aether. The game is played from both a first-person view(walking, running, jumping) and third-person view (morph ball mode and cut scenes). The game uses a combination of action, adventure, and platform game elements; while searching the player is able to uncover the story by finding federation reports and Luminoth lore. There are variety of puzzles to solve to reach new locations, different landscapes that the player can jump and grapple across and attack plenty of enemies. As usual, players begin the game with limited capabilities but additional weapons and suit upgrades can be found, including some standards from the Metroid series such as the varia suit, morph ball bombs, and missiles along with a few new weapons, such as the dark suit, dark beam, and light beam.<br><br>Metroid Prime 2: Echoes also features multiplayer modes for up to four players. In deathmatch, combatants need to hunt down each of the other players. This variation can be played either with a time limit or where the greatest number of frags wins. The second option is called bounty mode; in this variation each player starts with a number of bounty coins. When one player hits another player with a powerful attack, some of their coins will drop, which can be collected. Coins may also be found throughout the landscape, and the player with the most coins at the end wins.

Along the way, Samus meets with Federation members and other bounty hunters. Samus also runs into many old foes; one such foe, Dark Samus, corrupts her with Phazon energy that increases her powers via a PED (Phazon Enhancement Device). She can choose when to use this energy, but the Phazon will kill her if used for longer than a certain time period. <br><br>Gameplay is set within several 3D worlds, following the traditional Metroid formula of finding various armor and weapon upgrades to use, exploring areas, fighting numerous bosses, and avoiding environmental dangers.  Although the game contains several action-heavy sequences involving firepower, the game's main focus stays with using new items at various locations to discover previously unexplored areas.<br><br>The play control has been reworked to take advantage of the Wii's capabilities.

The Nunchuk accessory is used for grappling objects; this grapple ability can be used to pull obstacles out of the way, grab an enemy's shield from its grip, or to swing across a gap. Samus can also use the Morph Ball to roll through small spaces or to escape enemies; Samus can even jump while in Morph Ball form without using bombs. Additionally, Samus can call her gunship to assist in battles, travel to other planets, or provide a mobile save point.<br><br>Also new to the series are a collection of "Achievements", which can be unlocked by performing various tasks, such as killing a certain number of enemies, or scanning certain objects.

Description=Monsters vs. Aliens is based on the animated movie of the same name. During the course of the game the player takes control over three characters from the movie which all feature different gameplay elements. Missing Link, a mix between fish and human, has to survive levels which are similar to most licensed games from animated movies: a 3rd person platformer. <br><br>The sections with B.o.B., a slime monster, are more puzzle oriented. He can swallow enemies or items and use them to spit on other enemies. These are also used to press switches and as safety procedure when crossing bars - if B.o.B. had nothing solid in him he would just slip through them. With B.o.B. the player also has to solve mazes and shooting sequences. The last character is Gigantika, a 15 meters high woman. She uses trucks as inline skates and has to avoid obstacles by jumping or mastering quick time events (pressing a displayed button in a limited time).<br><br>In co-op mode the second player takes the role of a Dr. Cockroach and supports the main player with appropriate actions, e.g. shooting. The player can unlock a lot of bonus material, e.g. concept art, deleted scenes (in this case: levels) or audio commentaries.

The enhanced Konquest mode (story/adventure mode) improves over the preceding versions, but has a shorter length.

As described earlier, fatalities are a fancy way of killing your opponent and are pretty fun to watch. Various button presses and combos at the end of a fight will sometimes trigger fatality mode and if the right buttons are pressed the fatality can become a chain of fatalities. The Kreate-a-fatality allows you to redesign these finishers.<br><br>Perhaps the most amusing addition for longtime fans is the debut of "Motor Kombat," a racing mini-game patterned after Nintendo's Mario Kart. Motor Kombat has players selecting a vehicle from the following ten characters: Sub-Zero, Bo' Rai Cho, Scorpion, Mileena, Kitana, Johnny Cage, Jax, Cyrax, Baraka, and Raiden. Each super-deformed driver performs his or her trademark move on rivals, from Raiden's electricity to Scorpion's spear attack. The themed courses also feature hazards of their own, including lava pools, spikes, fire, and more. Motor Kombat supports four players in a split-screen view, or up to eight online.

Description=NBA Live 09 is a simulation of the basketball sport. In comparison the other versions this game is much more focused on a fast arcade gameplay - that's why both the Dynasty and the Be-a-Pro mode are missing. Here the player can only choose between a whole season, the play-offs or the FIBA World Championship. <br><br>The controls are adjusted to the special Wii movement controls which allow a more direct control over the players. It also features one special playing mode: All-Play. In this mode the player only controls the passes (by choosing the next player with the Remote), the dunks (by imitating the throwing movement) and snatching away the ball in the defensive (by shaking the controller) - everything else is controlled by the AI.

Description=The 2006 game in the Need for Speed series is an evolution of the gameplay introduced in the previous games. The career mode offers complete freedom in a city with a story mode supported by FMV cutscenes, as featured in Need for Speed: Most Wanted, but now also set in the Carbon Canyon, where racers duel for territory in the city below. There still are many police pursuits. At the same time, the focus on tuning and sculpting your car remains, as introduced in Need for Speed Underground. As you win money from races, you can visit garages and car lots to make improvements to your vehicle.<br><br>Enhancements are still unlocked gradually, but the cars have now been divided over different tiers. There are about 40 cars to unlock. Many of them have been featured in previous installments, but there is a new selection and this year's edition introduces powerful muscle cars such as the Ford Mustang and Dodge Charger. Other features include the possibility to form your own crew, more detailed sculpting features, drifting races (introduced in NFS:U and replaced by drag races in NFS:MW) and the new car classes. The PC, PS3 and Xbox 360 versions offer online multiplayer, missing from the PS2, GC and Xbox releases. Up to eight players can race together, in the Pursuit Tag or Pursuit Knockout modes, with a few variations. Pursuit Tag is a race of one civilian car against cop cars. To become the civilian car, you have to tag it and then try to fend off the cops as long as possible until you are tagged again by other players. In Pursuit Knockout everyone starts as a civilian car, but the last one at the end of the first lap becomes a cop and needs to cause as much damage as possible to the other speeders. Another mode allows you to drive cooperatively (up to four players) in a single race.<br><br>The city and the surroundings in the career mode have been divided into different territories, controlled by gangs. You are either invited or challenged to race in the sections and claim them as your own. To do so, you have to impress the gang leader by winning races until he challenges you for a duel - first in the city, then over the narrow roads of Carbon Canyon. Scores are based on proximity. You need to follow the boss in the first race, and he is in pursuit in the second one. There are 4 boss duels in total.<br><br>The crew feature, with room for up to 6 cars, allows you to assign three roles to racers: drafters, scouts and blockers. These are supporting characters you can hire to help you win races. Drafters leave behind a coloured trail that makes it easier to find the way, scouts discover hidden shortcuts, and blockers try to cause mayhem to slow your opponents down. If you hire a scout, you get access to the new AutoSculpt feature. It enables you to modify the height of every part of your car through sliders, solely for visual effect. You can also buy full body kits.

So the player enters the city with the goal to earn enough reputation and respect in the syndicate to get to him.<br><br>Of course this is not done by just walking up to someone and asking nicely. Instead the player freely roams the big city in his cars and accepts missions at every corner. These range from simple races to Burnout-inspired "Destroy as much as possible" goals. A completely new mode is the Highway Battle in which the player needs to put 300 meters between him and his opponent with the main enemy being the incoming rush hour traffic. Other missions require the player to bring a specific car in the best possible condition to a garage. Since the player is undercover, the police is always watching him and makes his life more and more difficult as the wanted level of the car increases.<br><br>Successful races not only earn the player reputation to unlock new challenges and new parts of the city but also bring cash which can be invested in new cars or in the tuning of old ones. In addition one of the ten stats of the character automatically advances granting him more money for a win or increasing his ability to brake.

You can even substitute second-stringers for the "skill" positions (QB, RB, WR, TE, and FS/SS) when your starters get tired.<br><br>Play perspective is very unusual: top-down slightly modified with a three-quarters tilt behind the offense, and the scrolling is diagonal, from the bottom left to upper right of the screen.  Each team has 12 passing and 12 running plays on offense, and the option to reverse play designs effectively gives you a total of 48 potential plays to run.  The defense has 8 cover plays and 8 blitzes to select from.  The kicking and punting games are handled with a fairly typical directional arrow/power meter system.<br><br>Games are divided into four 15-minute (accelerated real-time) quarters.  There are no penalties, but referees do appear onscreen to signal touchdowns/field goals, take measurements on short yardage plays, and shout "First Down!" (in audio) whenever a team moves the chains.  Team stats are displayed on a summary screen after every quarter of play.  Highest scoring team wins, which in playoffs mode means moving on to the next round--and an eventual shot at winning it all in the Power Bowl!

Also making the rescue mission difficult are several nasties that attempt to throw their own weapons, like bombs and arrows, at her. To defeat these enemies, Tiki shoots at them using her crossbow and arrows. More often than not, when Tiki shoots at enemies, they will leave behind pieces of fruit that she can pick up for points. However, it is likely that Tiki may get other weapons or the letters E, X, T, E, N, and D. Collecting all these letters will result in an extra life, and as for the weapons, they include laser shots, bombs, and fireballs. <br><br>In some levels, a few areas are located further up than just left or right, and the only way that Tiki can go up is by snatching something off the enemy that gives her the ability to fly up. Other areas are underwater, and when Tiki goes underwater, her oxygen  meter decreases, so she has to rise up to the surface again to restore her oxygen levels. Apart from her own weapons, Tiki is able to squirt water at enemies if she gets to the top of the water.

Based on the Ben Stiller movie, gameplay takes the player from the New York Museum of Natural History to the campus of the Smithsonian.

Description=In a realm of feudal Japanese folklore the eponymous Ninja Jajamaru-kun must rescue his beloved Princess Sakura from the clutches of a fiendish catfish-faced pirate. <br><br>Jajamaru-kun begins on the bottom of a three tiered horizontal field. On each level of this field there are two enemies on each tier. The tiers have weak brick ceilings that Jajamaru-kun can break by jumping into them. Once a passage is made Jajamaru-kun can move through them as can enemies. To clear a level all enemies must be defeated, most enemies can be killed by having a shuriken thrown at them, the only weapon available without a power-up, some need to be stunned either by falling through a hole in a tier or by being jumped on. Enemy projectiles can also be canceled out by the shuriken. Being touched by an enemy projectile, or in a few cases an enemies body, will instantly kill Jajamaru-kun. After an enemy has been killed its spirit will ascend, you can grab this for extra points.<br><br>In each stage at the 80 seconds remaining mark Princess Sakura will, fittingly, drop a cherry blossom onto the field. This will float through the platforms and eventually slip off the bottom of the screen, unless the ninja intercepts this message from his love. Once three blossoms have been collected a bonus stage will occur. In the bonus stage the foe is the Pirate Lord on the top throwing fire down onto Jajamaru-kun below. Here shuriken can be thrown upwards. One hit kills the pirate and frees the princess. As the game progresses these bonus stages become more difficult adding clones of the wicked lord and more fire.<br><br>As the levels progress the new enemies, based on Japanese folklore, emerge. A new enemy will always appear as a "boss". This new enemy will be the only one of its kind on the top tier and all the other spirits will be comprised of the previous boss. The boss will be more intelligent than the other minions. After a spirit has been the boss for several stages it will become the standard minion and loss some of its difficulty. A new more difficult boss will then appear for the next few levels, and so on.<br><br>Items can be found occasionally by breaking a brick ceiling, the items in any give stage are randomized.  Items once uncovered will remain until another ceiling is broken or are picked up. Items that alter the status of ninja have a transient effect.<br><br>The items in this game are:<br><br>1. Speed-up: This red ball will increase the determined ninja's speed, now he can get behind even the most cunning kami.<br><br>2. Ninja-cart: This little carriage can crush anything in it's path and move at incredible speeds, find this and your victory will be assured!<br><br>3.

Invisibility Potion: A highly potent blend capable of turning this ninja, if not totally invisible, into an invincible outline.<br><br>5. Inscribed Coins: These coins give additional points, different colors give different point valuations.<br>2. Extra Ninja: These little ninjas are extra lives, very rare!<br><br>6. Bombs: These two bombs can appear when a ceiling is cracked open. If the player is careless enough to jump into them after they are revealed he will surely meet his death. Enemies may pass through bombs with impunity.<br><br>7.

Description=In the 16th century, Japan's Sengoku ("Warring States") period divided the nation into numerous feudal states, each ruled by a daimyo. These daimyos would often go to war with each other. Many dreamt of conquering the land, becoming the Shogun and ruling the entire country. One of those daimyos was the ambitious Nobunaga Oda, a merciless ruler and a renowned strategist. Players take on the role of Nobunaga Oda or one of many other daimyos to try to conquer Japan. <br><br>Nobunaga's Ambition is a turn-based strategy game which can be played in different modes. Gameplay is similar to Koei's better known Romance of the Three Kingdoms game. Players begin by selecting either a 17 regions scenario or a larger 50 scenario. Then, the player must select a daimyo, each of which is rated attributes in several categories; Age, Health, Ambition, Luck, Charm and IQ. As the game progresses, these values change depending on events in the game. The age value represents a time limit of sorts, as an elderly daimyo becomes increasingly likely to die of old age or sickness.<br><br>During each of turn (one per season), players can issue one of several commands from a menu. They include: Recruiting new soldiers, Training the army, Buying  Weapons, Increasing Peasant morale, Forming alliances or Hiring Ninjas to bribe &amp; assassinate. When one player attacks another, there is a war fought over the defender's region. Battles are fought in an overhead-view hex battle map. Each player takes turn moving units and issuing orders, which include attack, move, bribe and surrender. The goal is to defeat all of the enemy units (or force them into surrender). Army units each have a certain weakness against other types of enemies, and are also affected by the terrain.

The main character Travis Touchdown wins a Beam Katana (reminiscent of a Star Wars lightsaber) through an online auction and decides to become a professional killer. He has a streak of otaku, not only though his looks but also through his love for J-Pop music, toy robots, wrestling and videogames. After defeating the assassin Helter Skelter in a battle, he is approached by the French woman Silvia Christel who offers him a job at the UAA, the governing body of assassins. He is given rank #11 and needs to kill his way to the top by defeating the other assassins.<br><br>The game is set in a free roaming world with open-ended gameplay, similar to the later Grand Theft Auto games. The main goal is to kill the other ten main assassins to progress the storyline, but there are numerous sidequests to earn money and additional weapons. Travis's main weapon is the katana, controlled through the Wii remote while the nunchuk is used for movement. Most attacks are performed using the A-button, while the position of the remote determines how high the katana is held. Others only become available by following on-screen instructions, leading to sword lock breaks and finishing moves. He also has a number of typical wrestling in close combat. There is a targeting system through the Z-button, B leads to a stun move and holding A and B together offers charged attacks.<br><br>During the journey, Travis is assisted by Doctor Naomi, a weapons maker, and Thunder Ryu who owns a gym where Travis can boast his statistics based on speed, combos and health. He moves around on foot or on his motorcycle Schpel Tiger. The visual style is similar to the grasshopper's previous game Killer7 with cel-shaded graphics. The game does not take itself serious and the over-the-top combat and animations offer a tongue-in-cheek counterweight for the graphical violence.

On his sixteenth birthday, he is given a suit of armor that belonged to his uncle, the Black Baron, which allows him to take his place as the Overlord.<br><br>As in the other Overlord games, you'll do fairly little of your own fighting. Most of the game is played through manipulating your minions. You direct your minions with the Wiimote and move the overlord himself with the Nunchuck. There are four types of minions: You start with browns, who are good melee fighters. As you progress, you gain reds, who are are immune to fire and can attack from a distance with fireballs, blues, who are healers and can swim and greens, who can turn invisible and clear poison.<br><br>Minions are summoned by spending life force, which you gain from fallen enemies.

As with many block-dropping puzzlers, if a line of blocks and/or ghosts reaches the top, the game ends. However, by filling up a meter on the left of the game area, a fairy may appear that can clear approximately 6 or 7 lines with ghosts, but it only clears the ghosts, although the blocks that were on top of them will drop.<br><br>Also, like many puzzlers, it contains a versus mode against another human player. It's similar to the many versus modes of puzzle games: eat plenty of ghosts and your opponent will recieve many ghosts on his area.<br><br>The game also includes a Puzzle mode.

Description=The people on a technically advanced planet Mota make experiments to create biomechanical creatures. But one day, a creature was created that appeared to be dangerous to the humans themselves. No signal came to the capital city from the experimental labs... You, a nameless young man living in Paleo, Mota's capital, are commanded to go to the labs and check the issue. Your friend Nei, a semi-human girl, goes with you, and other brave adventurers join you on what starts with a simple mission but develops into saving the entire world...<br><br>This is the first Phantasy Star game for the Genesis, set in a futuristic world.

Instead of magic there are "techniques", that require the usage of TP (technique points).

Description=The Algo star system is in troubled times...<br><br>Many thousands of years ago, the Algo Star System was a peaceful system. Three planets surrounded the peaceful Algo star and were in perfect harmony: Palma, a lush green planet, where its citizens devoted their lives to arts and the sciences. Motavia, a desert planet, inhabited by humans and native Motavians, and the enigmatic Dezolis, a harsh ice planet, where the citizens were just as unknown as the planet itself. Unfortunately, the harmony and balance was not to last. Palma had exploded, and with it, 90% of the population of Algo died. Motavia had fallen into horrible conditions from the explosion, turning almost into a total wasteland. The Darkness spread its hand over the land...<br><br>Now, 1,000 years had passed. Motavia had healed somewhat, and life was beginning to return to the way it once was thousands of years ago. The Hunter's Guild on Motavia helped to keep things steady. But now, a dark evil once thought to be long dead is beginning to stir once again, and the young Hunter, Chaz, is about to begin his ultimate adventure - and all of it started with one simple routine assignment...<br><br>The gameplay of the fourth entry in the  Phantasy Star is similar to that of the  second installment, sharing notable features such as the ability to equip two weapons at once, different healing items for humans and androids, most of the "techniques" (equivalent to magic spells in comparable games), etc. As before, leveling up and technique-learning is automatic. There are a few segments in the game with vehicle combat, which mostly follows the same turn-based formula as the regular battles. Side quests are present in form of hunter assignments for Chaz and his friends.

Description=Phantom Brave is a strategy RPG which takes place in the world of Ivoire. Ivoire consists of vast seas and numerous islands; it used to be a peaceful place, but an ancient (and powerful) force is now threatening life in the various lands. The character you control in the game is Marona, a 13 year old orphaned girl. Marona has the ability to communicate with phantoms, an ability that brings a lot of resentment from other people but will help her to head out into the world and solve the problems that are occurring. A phantom known as Ash acts as Marona's guardian; as the game progresses, other phantoms will join your party, each of which have different capabilities.<br><br>The game features a turn based combat system. During battles, Marona is able to attack enemies by herself, and she can also summon phantoms in her party to help out. To summon phantoms, you will need to confine them to an object on the screen (such as a rock or tree). Once confined to an object, you will then be able to control the phantom in battle, though phantoms only remain controllable for a limited number of turns. The object you confine a phantom to will affect it's abilities; for example, a rock may make a phantom stronger but move slower. By defeating enemies in battle you earn experience points allowing to level up and become more powerful.<br><br>The games story takes place in 20 episodes. Each episode features a unique goal to be completed before moving on. Between episodes you can visit your home on Phantom Island; here you can summon additional phantoms to join your party. Initially only a few types of phantoms can be summoned, but more become available as experience is gained. You may also replay already completed episodes or enter a random dungeon in order to level up your party and earn additional money to buy items.

If the wolves land safely on the ground, then they can climb a ladder, near the cable-car, and catch Mrs. Pig.  But if she shoots their balloons, they splat on the ground instead.<br><br>The wolves shoot acorns at the pig.  But Mrs. Pig has a food based weapon too.  If she gets to the top, she can get meat, to toss at the wolves and make them jump off their balloons in pursuit.  Each wolf taken out this way is worth bonus points (on a doubling scheme: 400, 800 1600...)<br><br>The second scene takes place at the wolves lair.  Here the wolves have reinforced balloons--it takes multiple hits to make them fall.  Here they float upwards toward a big rock, which they push on top of Mrs. Pig, when seven wolves are present.  Additionally, an alpha wolf (wolf leader) appears and summons wolves in packs.

Description=Pop puts a spin on the classic puzzle concept of popping bubbles. They enter the screen from different directions and players aim and need to click on them using the Wiimote. Bonus points are gained by popping bubbles in succession and this also adds time to the clock. The score and time is kept aside however until the chain is complete, and only then they are released. Chains can only be created by popping the same colour in succession without missing or waiting too long. The difficulty is not caused by a lack of bubbles on the screen, but rather by the large amount (with different colours) and the different speeds.<br><br>The single game gives players the chance to burst their way through waves of bubbles whilst grabbing power-ups (e.g. slow down the speed), multipliers, chains and aiming for worldwide high-scores. In multiplayer mode, Pop allows people to steal points from opponents and use the controller to pump up the bubbles for bigger explosions. Other power-ups darken the screen save for the player's area or immobilize the cursor by striking it with lightning. It can also be played cooperatively.

Alternatively, up to three players can play an episode as contestants in the game's "Party Mode."<br><br>Gameplay mirrors the game show it is based on. There are two rounds, each with a question phase and a board phase. Players are asked four multiple-choice questions in the question phase. Ringing in first and giving the correct answer nets you 3 spins. The other two players then get a chance to pick their answer to earn 1 spin. Incorrect answers gain no spins.<br><br>In the board phase, players use their accumulated spins to rack up cash. The board "spins" at random until the player hits a button to stop the cycle, earning whatever cash on the space the board stopped on. If the board stops on a cartoon "Whammy," that contestant's score is set to zero. Four Whammies removes that contestant from the game. The idea is to "press your luck" as long as you can, and then dump remaining spins off on another player in hopes of forcing them into a Whammy.<br><br>As players win games, they unlock new costumes and hairstyles for their avatar.

Description=Professor Heinz Wolff's Gravity is a puzzle game similar to the Incredible Machine series. During the 100 levels the goal is always to press a button. To achieve this goal the player has a selection of items to his disposal - nothing fancier than boards or balls - to build a construction of chain reactions. When he starts the experiment, a ball (in seldom cases a vehicle) gets released to set the thing in motion. An innovation compared to similar games is that the physics simulation doesn't get disabled during the building phase. This means the player can destroy his constructions when being careless during placing another item. There is also a help functions which gives hints to the correct solution.<br><br>By beating levels the player unlocks so-called sandbox levels where he can freely experiment with the physics engine. Mini games, e.g. building a tower which has to withstand an earthquake, can be played against other players. There are a small differences between the versions: the PC version offers an editor to build own experiments and the DS version offers fewer sandbox levels and mini games.

The hero character levels up automatically after winning a number of battles, adding new abilities and fresh spells to the available arsenal.<br><br>The battle screen has a grid of tiles occupying most of the central space, with the troops of the two fighting armies lined up at the sides. Each row and column has buttons to move them, and the  combatants take turns trying to make matches of three or more of the same type to charge their troops and increase the damage against the enemy when attacking. When one of the troops is fully charged, an attack button lights up at the top of the screen to unleash an assault against the opposite forces. Attack tiles have a similar effect, starting the maneuver when three or more of them are lined up on the grid.<br><br>The troopers have attack and defense statistics that determine the outcome of the attacks, with the alignment with the board colors and terrain effects increasing or decreasing their points. The player can retreat, a useful strategy when the battle is practically lost, allowing the remaining troops to be saved. There are four slots below the troop lines for spells, that can be used to change the number of specific tiles on the grid, alter statistics and help in other ways.

The puzzles themselves are similar to Bejeweled in execution, with a few slight variations used for things like item crafting and enemy capture.<br><br>When fighting an enemy (which can range from zombies to orcs and even castle strongholds, each with their own special spells and abilities), you both take turns using the same board. The goal is to reduce your opponents hitpoints to zero, which can be done directly by linking up skulls in rows of three or more, or by using spells which require mana. To build up mana, just link three or more runes of the same color together, just like the skulls. Every time you gain mana, it's stored in your reserves until you use it (or are hit with a mana draining attack). Gold and experience are built up in the same way, using gold coins or purple experience orbs that occupy the same board and can be linked just like runes and skulls.<br><br>The real strategy behind the game comes into play when you factor in elemental mastery (gaining extra mana when linking runes for a specific element), equipment (which can prevent damage, drain mana and more), spells (which can poison, drain mana, stun and so on) and linking up groups of four or more. The reason groups of four are important is that every time a row of four-of-a-kind is created, you get an extra turn. While it doesn't sound important, getting four runes in a row could possibly give you enough mana to cast an extremely powerful spell and give you the extra turn to cast it before your enemy can even move.<br><br>There is also a direct action mode in which players can hone their skills against various opponents independent from the story mode, as well as wireless multi-card play where two players can square off using their own characters from the campaign mode.

Description=Rock Band, by the original developers behind the Guitar Hero games, takes the concept a step further. Instead of solely playing the guitar along with songs, this game allows players to start a full virtual band with up to four players, with different sequences for each of the three supported peripherals: guitar (electric and bass), drum and microphone. Gameplay is based on hitting scrolling notes on the screen in time (scrolling vertically for drum and guitar), and getting the right pitch for the vocals (scrolling horizontally at the top of the screen, along with the lyrics).<br><br>The game offers a Solo Tour Mode for a single player or a Band World Tour (as well as Quick Play) for two to four players. By doing well players earn cash to customize the characters in the Rock Shop, with tattoos, face paint, clothing and logos. Customized characters are automatically locked to an instrument. Other customizations include movements on stage, instruments, and the general physique and appearance in the game. To succeed, players need to reach a set score through their combined performances. Multipliers for playing perfectly are tracked for the individual instruments and there can also be separate difficulty levels. The Star Power from the Guitar Hero series has been replaced by Overdrive, a meter filled by not making any mistakes in certain sections of a song. In band play using Overdrive also increases the band's score multiplier.<br><br>Players who fail during the song are locked out and the audio mix takes over. Other band members can revive the player by using their Overdrive. Failed players will however drag down the band's overall performance, so it becomes important to bring back band members. Next to the Overdrive sections, there are also Union Phrases (score bonus and extra Overdrive) and sometimes Big Rock Endings at the end of a song where another bonus can be gained.<br><br>In the Tour Mode players visit 41 venues in seventeen different cities. After the initial venues, others need a certain numbers of fans to be unlocked and certain continents only become available when tour buses or private jets are acquired. Not every venue comes with a set list of tracks. They consists of single tracks, multiple tracks, custom setlists or mystery setlists. Performing poorly can also have the band lose fans. Extra competition is included to attract managers, roadies and deals with record labels. <br><br>Next to the main modes there is also a versus mode for the individual instruments (Tug of War), Score Duel (get the most points) and a Tutorial mode. The PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions feature multiplayer games with new songs through downloadable content.<br><br>The European version is not sold as a single package. Instead, there is an instruments package and the game is sold separately, for a much higher price than the original US release.

Description=Rock Band 3 is the third game in the main Rock Band series, and features numerous new additions to the original game.  As with previous games in the series, players form a band (of up to seven players) and perform a song together using guitar, bass, drums, vocals (solo or harmonies) and new to this game, keyboard.  By working together, players can maximise their scores.  Each player can fill a power bar by performing special sets of notes.  When they have enough of these, they can activate "Overdrive" which adds a x2 multiplier for each player that has Overdrive activated simultaneously (so, for example, having four players with Overdrive activate will score you x8 rather than x2 for only one person).<br><br>Vocal harmonies, first introduced in The Beatles: Rock Band, are carried over into the main Rock Band series for the first time.  Up to three players can perform on the microphone, with one player performing the lead, and the remaining players performing backing vocals.  By keeping in harmony with each other, players can earn double or triple score, depending on how many players can keep up.  The game also introduces a new style of play for each of the instruments, "Pro Mode".  Pro Mode is more accurate to actual instruments for those players who are looking for an even greater challenge - guitars have multiple buttons on the fret board and players must actually strum strings, the drums must have the three cymbal attachment, while with the keyboard, even more keys are used so that the performance is much closer to actual play.<br><br>The Career Mode of the game has also been revised for this game.  Rather than grinding to earn money to unlock new items, the game is instead based around Achievement-like "goals".  Each goal you unlock earns you more fans for your band, and often unlocks new items of clothing or instruments.  All songs are initially unlocked so that those who just want to play for fun can, while those looking for a deeper experience can tackle the "Road Challenge" mode, which has you travelling to different venues and performing song sets.  Each star you earn for a song gets transformed into "Spades" at the end of the performance, and the more Spades you earn, the more goals you unlock which again translates into even more fans and items.  Bonus Spades can be earned by performing the requested tasks at the start of each song, such as continuously deploying Overdrive, performing note streaks while you're in the spotlight, or deploying Overdrive when full and then performing note streaks.

Description=Once upon a time, three evil gods fought against the holy gods, and the holy God-Father chose a human warrior to help them. Finally, after a prolonged, terrible war, the leader of the three evil gods - Death, the eldest of them - surrendered. The youngest evil god, Schirach, became a human and has lost her powers. The middle one, Saruin, was sealed away in the dark world. Now, after thousand years have passed, and the seal of Saruin has weakened, it is time for you, the hero of the new generation, to defeat him.<br><br>Romancing SaGa is the fourth installment in the long SaGa series - non-linear role-playing games with several main heroes. It is the first of three Super Nintendo entries. The first three games in the series were on the Gameboy and were known as "Final Fantasy Legend" outside of Japan. In this game, you play the stories of eight characters, which will later unite to face the ultimate evil. The eight characters belong to different classes and have different abilities. There are four male characters (noble son, thief, adventurer, and pirate), and four female ones (nomad, ranger, dancer, and savage). The combat is turn-based, with enemies visible on screen. Taking a cue from Final Fantasy II on the NES, instead of "Leveling" your character as a whole you level specific abilities such as a type of weapon or magic, as well as, stats such as HP and Strength and Intelligence. New to this entry abilities are randomly unlocked during battle as a light-bulb appears over the characters head and the new ability is unleashed to the surprise of friend and foe. This serendipitous element of gameplay along with the multiple heroes to choose from greatly enhance the replay value as no two playthroughs are alike. Which is good considering the steep learning curve of the SaGa games which require multiple playthroughs to truly master the system.<br><br>"Romancing SaGa" was never released outside of Japan until the Playstation 2 remake "Romancing SaGa: Minstrel Song"

The first levels have only a few rooms, but as the game progresses, new elements are introduced: locked doors, walls that need to be destroyed with explosives, ladders, teleporters, flooded rooms that kill the character and spinning rooms. The sliding-tile levels take place in four mansions, presented as jigsaw maps.<br><br>The mansions have chests that contain inventory items. Those objects are used in the separate adventure portion, where inventory puzzles have to be solved to win the four gold puzzle pieces necessary to finish the game.<br><br>The latest version of the game has the option of turning off the time limit.

Description=RTL Biathlon 2009 is a simulation of the Biathlon sport. Like the real sport it is basically divided into two sections: skiing and shooting. During the skiing sections the player steers his athlete into the correct direction and watches his stamina. In the middle of the screen is a power bar which gets filled by holding the assigned button - if the bar is too low the athlete gets slow and if it is too high he gets tired. Practically this results in steady button pressing to keep it as high as possible. During the shooting sequences the player shoots on targets while the cursor is wobbling. He can also hold his breath for a short time to steady his aim.<br><br>In the career mode the player divides points into four categories, e.g. speed or stamina, which influence the athlethe's capabilities. After successful championships he can improve these stats further. New in this instalment are super-powers which can be chosen at some point. When activated these give a big boost on a stat for a short time, e.g. "mountain skiing" boosts power when skiing uphill. These are available once per race. There are overall 15 courses which are partly licensed.

Description=R-Type is a side scrolling shoot 'em up best known for its extremely tough and strategic gameplay.  You control the R-9 spaceship as it launches a last-ditch effort to repel the evil Bydo empire.<br><br>The R-9 comes equipped as standard with a small gun which can only take down the smallest of enemies without firing several shots. By holding down the fire button, it can be loaded up so as to release a large burst of energy, eliminating all but the strongest enemies in its path. From time to time, pods will come flying in your direction. Upon being shot, they release an upgrade. The first one will invariably be the one called "The Force", which is a weapons pod that clings either to the front or the back of your ship, absorbing any enemy bullets or acting as a bumper with which you can fly head-on into them. You can also use it as an offensive weapon by firing it and pulling it back in. Mastering the Force is vital to surviving in R-Type, since it must be used both as protection against bullet clusters, as a remote controlled cannon, and in order to clear the screen from obstacles. Other upgrades give you target-seeking missiles or a bigger main gun. Different gun types, differentiated by their colour, serve different purposes. The blue one sends laser beams bouncing across the screen (good for tunnels), the red one fires straight ahead, and the yellow one follows any walls it may encounter (good for artillery emplacements).<br><br>The stages of R-Type are made in an organic style, certainly inspired by H. R. Giger's artwork for the Alien movies. When it came out, it was considered trend-setting since it broke off from the stereotypical sci-fi mould of other shoot'em'ups. In part, the levels themselves are your enemy, which is exemplified by the fourth, where spider-like creatures weave webs that cover the screen and block your path, or levels with intricate tunnel systems. Still, the levels are best handled with a combination of strategy and reflexes, without the memorisation that is required of R-Type's contemporary rival, Gradius.

Description=Samurai Warriors 3 marks the third title in the main series (not counting Samurai Warriors: Katana) and the first published by Nintendo, thus making the title an exclusive to the Wii.<br><br>Samurai Warriors 3 puts players in control of a historical Japanese figure during Japan's Sengoku, or "Warring States," period.  Several characters are selectable, and once selected, the player runs through the fairly typical Samurai Warriors formula.  Essentially, players drop into levels and cut through massive swaths of enemies working towards a boss, or "Hero," character.  Aside from the general hack-n-slash gameplay, players can also level-up characters, and unlock new armor and weapons.<br><br>There are several game modes in the game, but they mostly cover two main styles:  Players either traverse the game world following a story of Japanese unification, or plow through a different story to help a lost Samurai escape from a haunted house and demons.  This latter mode is the Murasame Castle mode, and is intended to be based on The Mysterious Murasame Castle, which was an old Famicom Disk system title.  Completed levels can be played at any time on their own.  <br><br>There are over 35 playable characters and the vast majority of returning characters have new models.  There are seven characters new to the series.  Each character has different styles, skills, and motives where the story is concerned.  Motives such as family, honor, or Japanese unification drive individual characters.<br><br>The game is playable with the Wii Remote and Nunchuck, the Classic Controller (or the Pro), or a GameCube controller.

This is the story of the 1983 movie Scarface in which Tony Montana dies during a attack from a rival gang on his mansion at the end. The game now puts the player in the shoes of Tony a few moments before the gang hits his office.<br><br>After he successfully defends his mansion, his empire lies in ruins. But Tony wouldn't be Tony Montana if he would just give up, so it is the player's goal to reclaim Miami once again. To do so, he has to earn money and respect. The only way to earn money in Miami is to deal drugs.  At the beginning the stuff is bought in small amounts and personally sold to the dealers. Eventually, however, Tony can set up so-called "Fronts" which are legitimate shops (like a car seller) in which drugs are sold in very large amounts. By overtaking "Fronts", Tony also increases his control over the current district of Miami. To completely overtake one part of town, all the enemy gangs scattered around in small groups must be eliminated.<br><br>After a deal, Tony has to launder the money at the local bank and have it transferred to his account. He then can buy "exotics" for his mansion like an expensive vase or a new car with a driver.<br><br>When talking with a dealer or trying to get cop heat down, the player has to play a mini-game that determines if Tony is successful and if so, how much he gets for the drugs or how much heat he loses.<br><br>Respect is earned by increasing Tony's territory, buying exotics and earning "balls" in fights and while driving. The enemies have different target zones which give a different amount of balls on a hit. This also fills up Tony's 'ball-meter". Once this is full he can enter a kind of god mode in which he is invulnerable and has unlimited ammo. Tony also gets health when killing someone in this mode. If he is driving a car he gets balls when making stunts like driving on the wrong side of the road or dodging an incoming car.<br><br>As in Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, the player is free to roam the city of Miami and there are also some side-missions with racing events.

Description=Named after the television boxing program airing on the US Showtime cable network, this game offers a mix of fourteen heavyweights and welterweights and four arenas to fight in (New York, Las Vegas, Los Angeles and Chicago). Basic moves include upper block, body block, dodging left and right, short punches and powered punches (hook, jab, uppercut, bodyshot). While playing, there are a few parameters to take into account. First there is a health meter that recharges when the boxer dodges hits for some time. Punches need to be thrown strategically, as an energy bar determines the effectiveness. Too many punches deplete the bar and the amount also determines if a boxer will be able to get up when knocked down. A round timer and knockdown lights are also shown. At certain times, a power-up indicator will become available. This allows a boxer to charge a heavy punch, but the opponent will have time to react. When the charging takes too long, the punch is lost.<br><br>The different game modes (different for heavyweight and welterweight) include:<br><br>1. Single Fights (Quick): fight for only one round until one of the boxers is knocked out.<br><br>2. Single Fights (Regular): play for 4, 6, 8, 10 or 12 rounds and choose to decide it by a KO, TKO or by points.<br><br>3. Points System: after each round each boxer is awarded points based on performance. At the end of a fight, or after a KO or TKO, the player with the most points wins.<br><br>4. Belts: series of three (Amateur), four (Contender) or six (Showtime) fights. Each fight lasts four rounds or three minutes and the aim is to win one of the belts.<br><br>5. King of the Ring: one boxer takes on all other boxers in his weight division in one long round.<br><br>Additional fighters are unlocked by winning competitions.

If you fail to land on the landing strip, you run out of fuel and crash.<br><br>You can only shoot horizontally and diagonally by tilting the plane's nose. When in trouble, perform an aerial loop with the secondary button, this often destroys other planes and avoids bullets. There is a co-op mode with the character Max as well.

Wandering around each level are a variety of enemies which will cause you to lose a life if you're caught. Some creatures can be killed by destroying the block they are standing on, others must be dodged. Hidden bonuses and magic can be found on many of the levels, sometimes even hidden in blocks. Some treasures give you bonus points, others can form magic spells to help deal with the enemies. To make the game more difficult, each level has a time limit in which it must be completed.

Seven levels separate Sonic from the final showdown with Robotnik.<br><br>Sonic 3D was the last Sonic title released for the Mega Drive, the only platforming presence of the blue blur in the Sega Saturn, and one of his rare appearances in Personal Computers. The title, considering the era it was released, is somewhat misleading, as instead of full blown 3D graphics it uses an isometric view where Sonic can move not only forwards and backwards, but also left and right. <br><br>Gameplay is much slower when compared to other games in the series, and the number of badniks is reduced to five in each section. As usual, when Sonic destroys one badnik, an animal leaps free from its insides, but this time Sonic has to pick him up and lead them to an interdimensional ring. While they can be taken one by one, exploring the level with all five allow the player to reach for otherwise inaccessible continue tokens. <br>Unlike all other previous games, time isn't a requirement: if the player completes a level in more than 10 minutes, it would only mean there would be no time bonus at the end. Finally, to collect all seven Chaos Emeralds, Sonic first must find Tails or Knuckles and offer them at least 50 rings.

Description=Sonic and Knuckles continues the story directly from where Sonic the Hedgehog 3 left off.  The explosion from the Death Egg sends Sonic flying deep into Floating Island's Mushroom Hills.  Sonic knows of the Master Emerald hidden somewhere on Floating Island, and is sure that Dr. Robotnik wants it to give his Death Egg limitless power.  Knuckles probably knows where it is - but can Sonic stop Robotnik's plans and find the Master Emerald all while fighting off Knuckles?  Meanwhile, Knuckles is guarding Floating Island when he's attacked by one of Robotnik's robots!  He quickly begins a chase for revenge.<br><br>Sonic & Knuckles is the fourth game in the Sonic series.  It retains the same basic features as in the previous Sonic games (speed, rings for protection, Special Stages with Chaos Emeralds) as well as the three different shield types introduced in Sonic 3 (Fire, Water and Electric).  Players can select either of the two title characters for play - either Sonic, or the all-new Knuckles the Echidna.  Knuckles cannot jump as high as Sonic, but he can glide by holding the jump button while in the air.  If you glide into a wall, Knuckles will also be able to climb it.  He can also break through walls that Sonic can't.  With these abilities, Knuckles can access different areas from Sonic, making for each level an entirely new experience.<br><br>Unlike Sonic 3, Sonic & Knuckles features three bonus stages - two are available by jumping into the lamppost checkpoint stars (as in Sonic the Hedgehog 2.  These stages give you the chance to earn bonus rings, lives and power-ups.  The first is a Casino-themed level where you can jump into a slot machine and earn (or lose!) rings.  The second is a more skill-based level where you must time your jumps off orbs to launch higher and collect bonuses.  If you hit the barrier at the bottom of the stage, it ends.  The other type of bonus stage is the "Special Stage" seen in Sonic 3, which, as previously, can be accessed by jumping into giant rings hidden within the levels themselves.  If the player collects all the blue spheres in these stages (while avoiding all the red ones) they will earn a Chaos Emerald.<br><br>A unique feature of the Sonic & Knuckles cart is the ability to "Lock-On" previous Sonic games into a cartridge slot at the top.  Adding Sonic 3 will combine both Sonic 3 and Sonic & Knuckles into one long game, as well as adding the ability to save, and use Tails in the Sonic & Knuckles levels.  Plugging in Sonic 2 lets players use Knuckles in Sonic 2, as well allowing the use of his glide and wall climb abilities.  Finally, plugging in the original Sonic the Hedgehog cart lets the player access unlimited level variations of the Blue Sphere bonus stage.  Subsequent re-releases of Sonic & Knuckles have also included most of these bonus features.

Description=The easiest way to describe Sonic & SEGA All-Stars Racing would be to call it a Super Mario Kart clone. But instead of featuring famous Nintendo-characters like Mario and Bowser, the players use Sonic, Billy Hatcher, Dr. Eggman and 17 other more or less famous characters from the SEGA games library.<br><br>The core gameplay remains the same though: in a normal race the player has to compete against seven other racers using both his racing skills and one of the several different power ups that are scattered around the track like a boxing glove to shoot racers in front out of the way or mines to destroy his pursuers. Since all cars drive at the same speed, no matter which character they belong to, charging up the boost by doing drifts is the most important thing in order to get to first place. Tricks are also available to gain access to a turbo-boost. But the decision what racer and car to use does influence which All-Star-Action is available to the player. While Sonic the Hedgehog turns into Super Sonic for a short while, giving him a great amount of additional speed, Billy Hatcher lays egg-shells on the track to obstruct his followers. Like all other power-ups, the All-Star-Action has to be collected on the track first before it can be used.<br><br>The game features several different game-modes. In single player the player can either do time trials, single races, a Grand Prix or one of the several dozen missions that are available and require the player to fulfil many different goals other than simply being the first in a race. These goals include using one long drift to get to the finish line, roll over as many crows as possible or get to the finish line without destroying any pots and many more. <br><br>Multiplayer consists of a split screen mode for up to four players and an online mode (not available in the PC-version). Besides normal races several battle modes are waiting like King of the Hill or simple Deathmatch. Completing a mission or winning a race either in single player or in multiplayer earns the player SEGA miles which are used in the internal shop to unlock additional characters and tracks.<br><br>The Xbox 360-release features in addition to the SEGA characters and tracks also Rares Banjo-Kazooie - hence the additional subtitle.

With Knuckles tricked and trying to stop the heroes at every turn, will they be able to stop Robotnik in time?<br><br>Sonic the Hedgehog 3 is the third in the Sonic series of games.  As with the previous games, it is a side-scrolling platformer based around speed.

Sonic can jump on enemies to defeat them, and Spin Dash by holding down and the jump button, then letting go of down.<br><br>New to Sonic 3 are three different types of shields - the Fire Shield (which protects you from fire but disappears if you enter water), the Water Shield (which lets you breathe underwater infinitely) and the Electric Shield (which pulls nearby rings towards you).  Sonic can use extra abilities when he has these shields by pressing jump while in the air - either a horizontal fireball dash, a vertical bubble bounce, or an electric double jump.  If Sonic has no shield active, he can activate a brief energy shield, also by pressing jump in the air.  Tails cannot use the shields' special abilities, but he can instead either fly or dog paddle (in water) for a limited time.  He can also carry Sonic with him while doing so.<br><br>There are now two types of bonus stages - one is available by collecting 50 or more rings, running past a checkpoint lamppost and then jumping into the stars (as you could in Sonic the Hedgehog 2.  This stage give you the chance to earn bonus rings, lives and power-ups.  In this stage, there is a giant gumball machine.  By hitting the crank, you'll spit out a bonus item that can either be rings, lives or bonus shields.  The stage is over when you fall down the bottom of the screen.<br><br>The other, more important, Special Stage can be accessed by jumping into giant rings that are hidden away in secret areas in each level.  In these stages, you must collect all the blue spheres while avoiding the red ones (which end the stage early).  Collecting all of the outer blue spheres around square or rectangle sphere formations will turn them all into rings - if you collect 50 or more in this stage, you can earn a continue.

Dr. Robotnik), once again by destroying his Death Egg and returning the stolen Master Emerald. The victory, however, is short-lived, as Eggman is up to revenge and rebuilds and improves his greatest creations for the sole purpose of destroying Sonic once and for all.<br><br>The game does not only return to the original series in terms of story and title, but also in terms of gameplay. Sonic 4 is a classical 2D sidescroller like its predecessors and also features the same game mechanics as the old games. There are some new additions, for example the &quot;Homing Attack&quot; which locks on Sonic's jump on enemies, jumping pads or breakable items. One major difference are the graphics, as Sonic 4 uses polygons for the Sonic characters and prerendered graphics for everything else, so does not recreate the looks of its predecessors, unlike, for example, Mega Man 9.

The symbiote substance terrorizes the city as it spreads and attaches to innocent citizens. Spider-Man begins a quest to save New York City.<br><br>He sees the epidemic sweeping the streets below as hes able to swing over and between buildings with great speed and agility hunting down baddies.

The player has the ability to change suits easily where you can defeat bad guys as either the red Spidey using his web or the black Spidey using the tendrils from the symbiote. Other destructive combo attacks are the same regardless of suit color. Choosing one suit color over the other is more of a players personal choice for each fight and doesnt have an impact on the games outcome. However, the player will be forced to make decisions during the game that are equal to Spider-Mans red suit or black suit morals.

In the game the player learns more about the mysterious bounty hunter Cad Bane and hunts down the all-new Skakoan super villain Kul Teska in a gameplay-style very simliar to Lego Star Wars.<br><br>The game is fully build around drop in/drop out-coop for two players. This means each mission in this 3rd-person-action-adventure features two famous characters from the TV series including Obi-Wan Kenobi, the padawan Asoka and Captain Rex but separated by class. The players either control commandos or Jedi-characters - never both mixed as they have totally different abilities and limitations. If no second player is available, the AI will automatically take over the second character and help overcome the many obstacles waiting ahead - mostly in form of several different kinds of separatist droids. While the players can use their lightsaber or blaster to fend them off, the Jedi-characters also have the ability to ride the droids by jumping onto them from behind. This is not only useful to blast through enemy lines but is also used to solve specific riddles preventing the characters from moving on. In addition the droids can be forced to dance with every other droid on the screen following his lead making them defenseless. These dances are unique for each droid and need to be bought first in the shop. Also available there: funny masks and combat upgrades like stronger blasters or a more powerful force-push.<br><br>To buy these things, the players have to unlock them first and then need to invest points which are gained by killing enemies as well as by successfully completing missions or the mini-games. These mini-games are scattered around the levels and turn up once a specific section has been completed. They mostly involve killing as many enemies as possible in a short amount of time. Each kill in succession both during normal gameplay and the mini-games also ranks up the multiplier adding even more points to the account. Once a player dies, he will respawn at the nearest checkpoint either immediately if he plays alone or after the second player has reached one - both times without any penalties.

Three buttons are used, one to jump, other to attack and another to perform a range attack from a support police car. Each character has a limited set of moves that include punching and kicking or performing a back attack (if in the open), two grapple moves (depending if holding the opponent in front or by the back), a flying attack, and if playing with another player two additional tag attacks, and different abilities: Adam is slow, but a good jumper and a hard hitter, Axel fast and also a hard hitter, but a lousy jumper and Blaze fast and a good jumper, but weak hitter.<br>Levels are in typical arcade side-scroller fashion: move from left to right (with two exceptions), clearing screens from enemies one after another as fast as possible while avoid taking damage with a boss in the end. Some levels feature "death drops" where the player must avoid falling, while throwing enemies there at the same time, including a typical elevator level.  Several items are scattered on the ground, from melee weapons and bonus points (and lives or additional police cars) to apples and turkeys (to restore health).

The mentioned rhythmic motions depend on the input device the player uses, e.g. at the swimming event the player needs to press two buttons alternately when using a keyboard and rotate the analog sticks when using a gamepad.

Description=Eight Olympic events feature in this game, and any selection of these can be played at a time. There is no pure sprinting, and only the rowing and cycling can be thought of as pure joystick-waggling. The triple jump involves pressing right to start the hop (before reaching the white line), right again for the step as you land, left as you land for the jump, and then up to propel you through the sand.  I high jump, after selecting a height you feel you can clear, you use up and down to control the speed, fire to jump, and then forward to propel you over the bar.<br><br>For the javelin even you hold down fire to build up speed, and push left to throw the javelin, holding it left before releasing to change the angle. In the equestrian event, you must use up to increase speed, and fire or right to jump when appropriate to clear the hazards - too many faults will see you disqualified.<br><br>Fencing involves moving your foil using the joystick, always staying one step ahead of your opponent, retreating when appropriate. The kayaking event involves navigating a river by controlling the direction, ensuring that all the gates are past correctly even when this requires some precise lining up. You can also load the events from Summer Games 1 in, to play all 16 events in a marathon session.

Mario has tighter ground control, while Luigi has greater jumping capabilities.<br><br>Power-ups remain the same: Super Mushrooms grow a brother from small to Super size, Fire Flowers give them the ability to throw fireballs at enemies, Starman makes a character temporarily invincible, and a 1-Up Mushroom will give one more life.  New to this game is a power-down, a Poison Mushroom which will harm you as if it were an enemy.<br><br>The goal is still to survive from the left side of the level to the right, avoiding perils and bopping enemies along the way, progressing through a series of 8 worlds with 4 levels each.

Description=Super Smash Bros.: Brawl is the third game in the Super Smash Brothers series of brawling games. It is a crossover fighting pitching well-known characters from Nintendo franchises, along with characters from other series, against each other. The battles take place in 41 stages with up to four players fighting at the same time. New stages can be designed using the included Stage Builder. Unlike other fighting games, players do not need to drain the opponent's health. Instead, the game is won when a player manages to knock the opponent off the stage, although some games modes only award a point to the victorious player, continuing the fight. The fighting itself does have an influence however. The character's vitality is represented by a percentage. Starting at zero, the higher it becomes, the further the character flies away when hit, improving the chances to have him disappear off the stage. Characters have certain recovery moves to get back, but each stage has a certain boundary from where no return is possible.<br><br>Each character has basic and advanced attacks (smash attacks), as well as character-specific special moves. They can also make use of items, projectiles, custom weapons and other items. This edition introduces super attacks referred to as final smashes. Activated by destroying smash balls, these feature powerful and often unstoppable attacks, regularly introducing a major transformation of the character. Other help is introduced through assist trophies (a computer-controlled character temporarily helping out) and Poké balls (a character from the Pokémon universe joins the fight).<br><br>The single-player mode is called The Subspace Emissary and features cut-scenes with all playable characters. It is team-based, and new characters will temporarily join or leave the team for which the player can determine the battle order. Other modes include Classic (a series of matches), Events with pre-determined battle conditions - also for co-op, and the Stadium mode with mini-games such as Home-Run Contest and Target Smash!<br><br>There are 35 playable characters in total (both old and new, with some removed from previous iterations), and certain characters can acquire alternate fighting styles or transformations making a total of 37 selectable. There are 23 characters available right away:<br><br>Bowser (Mario games)<br>2. Diddy Kong (Donkey Kong games)<br>3. Donkey Kong (Donkey Kong games)<br>4. Fox (Star Fox series)<br>5.

Description=The story of this game is based on Episode IV: A New Hope, the first of the original  Star Wars movie trilogy. The player initially controls the movie's main hero, Luke Skywalker, but two more controllable characters join later: the careless captain Han Solo and his Wookie side-kick, Chewbacca. The game generally follows the movie plot, allowing the player to experience some of the most important sequences, such as the search for Obi-Wan Kenobi, rescuing princess Leia, and the final confrontation against Death Star and its TIE Fighters, led by the mysterious Darth Vader.<br><br>Most of the game levels follow traditional platform gameplay style. As Luke, Han, or Chewbacca, the player makes his way through the linear levels, fighting enemies, jumping over obstacles, and collecting power-ups. The power-ups include standard health-restoring items, upgrades for the blaster gun (up to five different upgrade levels), as well as special items that can be used for massive destruction of the enemies. Luke uses a weak blaster gun, but later gains access to a lightsaber, being able to fight enemies melee-style. Han and Chewbacca use stronger flame guns, but cannot upgrade to better weapons.<br><br>Some of the levels are dedicated to familiar Star Wars vehicles (such as a land speeder). Controlling the vehicle from a third-person view, the player has to navigate it through the pseudo-3D environments, avoiding obstacles and shooting at enemies on the way.

Description=The sequel to  Super Star Wars is, as the name implies, based on Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back, the second of the original  Star Wars movie trilogy. The game features familiar locations and events from the film, such as the ice planet Hoth, the search for Yoda on the jungle planet Dagobah, and the fight against Darth Vader. Several locations are expanded, adding places and boss enemies that did not exist in the movie, and certain key events in the story are omitted or changed. <br><br>As in the previous game, the player is able to control three characters: Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, and Chewbacca. Unlike the first, each character has been given a distinct special move. Chewie spins a path of destruction through enemies, Han has grenades and a powerful slide, and Luke can switch to his lightsaber and block oncoming fire. Gameplay is very similar to the first game, mostly focusing on platforming elements. As before, there are Mode-7 vehicle levels, during which the player is able to pilot a snowspeeder against encroaching Imperial walkers, pilot the Millennium Falcon through the asteroid field, and break through Cloud City's defenses in Luke's X-Wing fighter. <br><br>The game's other major addition is the inclusion of a suite of Force powers for Luke. They are learned by collecting hidden orbs on the Dagobah level, and add a second special bar that depletes with each usage of a Force power. Power-ups include health items, weapon upgrades, screen-clearing detonators, and orbs that restore Luke's Force power. Passwords have also been added, and are given upon completion of each of the game's 25 stages.

Team up and battle to create the best team of all... can you defeat all the All-Stars?<br><br>Tatsunoko vs. Capcom Ultimate All-Stars is a 2D fighting game which pits characters from the Tatsunoko and Capcom franchises against each other (a series which first started with Marvel vs. Capcom).  Players choose two characters from the large roster of characters.  Rather than having two "rounds" of battle, each battle is one long continuous round - if one of the player's characters is KO'd, then they'll automatically switch to the other one.  If the other character is KO'd at this point, then the player loses the match.<br><br>To prevent this from happening, players can swap characters dynamically during the match.  When a character takes damage, some of their health bar will turn red - if the player swaps the character out at this time, the red bar will recover.  In addition, players can use an 'Assist' attack as they swap in their character to deal more damage to their opponent.  By strategically swapping and attacking, players can turn the tables on their foes.<br><br>Each character has, as well as standard light, medium and strong attacks, special moves suited to their character (such as Ryu's Hadoken) and hyper combos which can only be used when the hyper combo gauge is filled.  These attacks cause much more damage than standard attacks and are often difficult to block.

There is also an enhanced career mode where you can master your skills in a new Practice Facility. The golfers have a new animation state engine that yields more pertinent emotions and reactions based on what happens in gameplay.

Players can unlock additional golfers and spend their winnings in the shop on new equipment.<br><br>The game incorporates the FedExCup championship format (a collection of tournaments) with rounds of golf at Westchester Country Club, TPC Boston, Cog Hill, and East Lake.

Shot Confidence is a new addition, keeping track of the player's performance on certain courses, for specific puts and using certain clubs. Great performances raise the confidence, which translates into experience and better performance on specific courses. Low confidence leads to lower accuracy, a pumping heartbeat, and rumbling controls on the Wii.<br><br>The multiplayer (up to 4 players) has been expanded with GamerNet, where players can create and play custom challenges with their scores posted online (Xbox 360/PS3/Windows).<br><br>On the Wii, players can shake the controls to taunt the opponents with 4 different moves, to throw them off.

A mysterious figure calling himself the "Nightwatcher" has turned up, and a shadowy rich man named Winters seems to be in cahoots with the remnants of the Foot Clan.  Only the Ninja Turtles can clean up the streets!<br><br>TMNT is an action game, similar to Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time.  Play as Leonardo, Michelangelo, Raphael and Donatello, swapping on the fly and using special co-operative moves to help your brothers in battle.

Most of the game is spent making your way to the next destination by using your ninja moves to explore New York.  Each character also has their own special move: Leo can traverse through walls, Raph can use his Sais to scale particular surfaces, Mikey can use his Nunchucks as helicopters to float for a short period, and Don can pole vault across long gaps with his Bo Staff.<br><br>Sometimes, battles will occur - in these situations, you'll be locked in an arena and must battle all your enemies before you can move on.  Battling is a simple affair - you can use one button for standard attacks (charge it for a more powerful one), and another button for light attacks that push enemies away.  If your fellow turtles are with you, you can also hold down your character swap button for a tandem co-op attack.  Some levels will allow you to play as the Nightwatcher - he fights similarly to the Turtles, except that as the more he fights, the more his 'rage' builds, which can cause a devastating surrounding attack when fully charged.  The Wii version of the game controls similarly to all other versions, except that gestures are used for attacking instead of button presses.<br><br>The basic goal for each level is to get to the end.  At the end of each level, you're graded on the following attributes: your speed, your combat, and the amount of coins collected.  In levels where you work with your brothers, you'll also be graded on how well you worked together.  Succeed in a these attributes, and you'll earn turtle coins which can be used to purchase unlockables.  If you get an A Rank or higher in a level, you'll also unlock a Challenge Map, which can be played to earn even more turtle coins.  Finally, once you've played any level at least once, turtle coins will appear in hard-to-reach spots for you to collect.

Description=Tomb Raider: Underworld concludes the story of Lara's search for her mother who is supposedly trapped in a place called Avalon. Continuing the events from Lara Croft Tomb Raider: Legend and Lara Croft Tomb Raider: Anniversary, her search brings her once again to locations around the globe from the cold wastes of the Arctic to the beautiful landscapes of Thailand. This time even the bottom of the Mediterranean Sea is not save from Lara's exploring. At the same time the game continues to explore the idea of monomyth, this time incorporating the influences of the Norse mythology into its narrative.<br><br>The basic gameplay remains the same as in most of the previous iterations of the series with the focus on exploring, solving riddles and dodgy climbing passages instead of instant action and gun fights. For this Lara once again learned a few new moves including jumping between the walls introduced in Prince Of Persia: The Sands Of Time.<br><br>To help the players with the riddles, the game not only features a sonar map, showing Lara's immediate surroundings as a 3D grid for better orientation around the levels. Also, if asked, Lara gives general but helpful tips on what to do next.<br><br>The differences from the previous Tomb Raider games developed by Crystal Dynamics include the complete lack of QTE events. Instead the time slows down in critical moments, but the player still retains full control of the Lara's movements. Another change is the more non-linear level design more in vein with the traditional entries of the series.

Symptoms are matched up with illnesses through a computer interface, with a meter increasing as the likely cause is narrowed down. The ultimate goal is a correct identification of the patient's ailment.<br><br>Orthopedics has the player performing skeletal surgeries such as reinforcing bones and replacing artificial joints. Each surgery is done in very specific steps, with the correct tool automatically selected at each stage. The Wii Remote is used to set bones, screw in metal plates, or hammer in pins. The vitals meter is removed in this mode, and players are allowed a limited number of errors (swinging the remote too hard, missing a screw, etc) before failing the surgery. Performance is ranked by a running "chain" meter that adds multipliers for performing actions without mistakes.<br><br>Endoscopy has the player inserting and guiding a camera tube into the patient in a first-person view from the camera. Players feed the tube into the patient by pushing the Wii Remote forward, and must steer to avoid hitting the walls of the veins or cavities the tube is traveling through. After locating the goal of the surgery (tumors, lesions, etc), the player must select tools and accurately apply them as in the surgery game. In two-player mode, players switch between controlling the endoscope and aiming its light.<br><br>Forensics introduces various crime scenes the player must investigate. This mode plays similar to a traditional point-and-click adventure, with the player using the Wii Remote's pointer to locate and examine clues around the area. Players can also examine victims and perform autopsies. Clues or important points take the form of cards, which may be sent off for analysis, or combined with other cards. The player then uses these cards (or multiple choice answers) to answer questions regarding the specifics of the crime to proceed with the investigation.

Description=In the first Uncharted Waters game, it was the 15th century and the New World was discovered. Now in New Horizons, it is the early 16th century and the age of exploration and sea trade is underway. Players choose from any one of six adventurers (scenarios), each with their own distinctive but intertwining plot, to embark on a quest of sailing, seamanship and exploration. The six characters are:<br><br>1. Joao Franco is the son of Duke Leon Franco, the hero of the first Uncharted Waters game and an influential man in Portugal. His father wants to make him into a strong man and so decides to send him out to sea. Young Joao is tasked with learning the skills of the sailor (he is the only character who starts at level one) and embarking on a quest of discovery; reaching the far east and eventually looking for the secret of Atlantis.<br><br>2. Catalina Erantzo is a Spanish naval officer who believes her beloved and her brother were both murdered by the Portuguese armada. Vowing revenge she turns to a life of piracy and soon becomes a red haired scourge of the seas.<br><br>3. Pietro Conti is a indebted man, having inherited the financial woes of the Conti family. When the Duchess Franco hires him to spy on her son, he accepts the job and obtains a ship. Pietro hopes to use these resources to seek out valuable treasure and clear up his family's debt.<br><br>4. Ernst Von Bohr is a geographer who is teaching classes in Holland. But he yearns to leave the classroom and sail the high seas, living a life of adventure that he has only read about in books. When his friend, Mercator offers to finance his initial voyage in exchange for cartography information about the world, Ernst is given the opportunity to live out his dream.<br><br>5. Ali Vezas is a poor orphaned child living in Istanbul and serving others. He dreams of becoming his own master and making his own fortune across foreign lands. A twist of fate aides in providing him with small loans, with which he is able to afford his first ship and sail out with a cargo hold full of goods...<br><br>6. Otto Baynes styles himself a Royal Knight of the British Empire, in the service of his majesty the king. Promoted to Admiral of the British fleet, the kingdom is worried about the increased naval power of Spanish fleets. Otto is given a letter of marque by the king and ordered to terrorize the Spanish Fleet. Equipping himself simply at first, Otto strives to become a great Privateer in the name of King and Country.<br><br>Regardless of the character chosen, Uncharted Waters: New Horizons is a top-down sailing simulation. At sea, players control the direction of their ship, where speed is affected by the number/health of the crew, the wind and the currents. Players can navigate anywhere there is water (though some ships are not ocean worthy) and discover interesting landmarks and new ports. Upon landing at a port, the view is also top-down and the player can enter different buildings, each with unique services and goods. These include: The Inn, the Item Shop, The Shipyard, The Tavern, The Castle, The Guild Hall, The Church, The Merchant and the Harbor. It's up to the player to earn enough gold to keep the crew fed and financed and keep the fleet repaired. Primary methods of earning money are through sea trade, accepting jobs from the guild, gambling and battle with other ships.<br><br>During naval combat, the game becomes a turn-based top-down strategy game, with the player moving ships in order to obtain trajectories needed to fire cannons at enemy ships, or run alongside enemy vessels in order to board them. If the player's flagship attacks the flagship of the enemy fleet, they can challenge the opponent to a duel. If accepted, the game changes to a side-view of the two captains engaged in a fight. During this sequence, the player can only choose which fighting maneuver (strike, thrust, parry, lash) they wish to engage in.

The borders of the area which the player has not cleared become the border of the area the player's pointer can move along.<br><br>The player's object must avoid contact with any of the enemies which float around the screen, as this will weaken and eventually destroy it.

But the game is different in other ways. For instance, players shake the Wii Remote without holding an enemy to punch the ground.

Wario can also throw things, including enemies, by tilting the Wii Remote in the direction the player wants to aim them. Special treasures can be collected in each level. Players must find imprisoned Merfles in each level; when a Merfle is found and released, a countdown starts to return to the beginning of the level. There is a boss at the end of each area. Any level can be revisited to complete missions; these missions consist of anything ranging from gathering so many coins to escaping a level after saving a Merfle under a certain time.

The A button lets Toad pick up the whole stack that is in front of him, the B button lets him only pick up one object, even if it's in the middle of a stack, the Y button lets him kick a monster or bomb that's in front of him and the X button places him on top of the stack that he is carrying. He can also run up walls and stacks to catch falling objects out of the air or to pick up certain parts of a stack.<br><br>There are 5 different modes of play: a "Round Game" in which Toad has to clear numerous levels, a match versus a computer controlled opponent, a two player mode, a "Time Race" mode, and finally, an extensive training mode.<br><br>There are some differences between the SNES and NES versions.

By collecting the right power-up you can transform into Wonder Momo for a limited time, who can perform ranged attacks with a hoola-hoop and is more powerful than regular Momo.<br><br>Not only must you clear the enemies of each stage, but also please the crowd with your performances, being wary of perverts that attempt to take pictures of your underwear whenever you attack (Momo shows quite a bit of leg whenever she "kicks high") which results in blinding flashes that stun Momo and leave her open to an attack.

Description=World of Goo is a physics-based puzzle game where players need to build constructions using balls of goo. The original concept is based on the prototype Tower of Goo Unlimited! by Kyle Gabler, one of the developers of this game, created for the Experimental Gameplay Project website.<br><br>Rather than a series of puzzles, the game presents the balls of goo as living creatures in a universe they set to explore. They need to find out about the power source of the world they live in and the true meaning behind the Goo Corporation. In most of the levels, the constructions need to reach a pipe that sucks the goo balls out of the level. To succeed, players need to bring over a certain amount of balls or do it within a limited amount of time. There are also OCDs (Obsessive Completion Distinction) where players can aim for secondary, much more difficult goals.<br><br>Each level brings entirely new challenges, based on gameplay, environment elements, art style and types of goo balls. Regular balls can be dragged and dropped with the mouse or wii remote to form cohesive connections, but only for a short distance. Because of the physics and the wobbly matter, a solid basis is required. Balls can be picked up and moved around to adapt the constructions. While buildings sometimes timebugs will appear. When clicked, they allow the player to go back in time for one move. The types of goo differ greatly in abilities, connections and response to physics. Some of the goo balls introduced gradually are ivy goo (attach and detach at will), albino goo (four connections), balloon goo (fly upwards), water goo, pokey goo, fuse goo, bone goo, and much more. In some levels, sleeping balls can be woken up to join the construction. Constructions not only bend, but can also be broken when gravity gets the upper hand. In later chapters, players acquire a whistle that can be used to lure all loose goo balls in a certain direction.<br><br>More of the world is revealed through cut-scenes and sequences during gameplay, always with a humourous nod. There are five main chapters with different levels that follow chronologically for one year in the world of goo. The environment is changed to reflect the season. Often, players will save more balls of goo than required. These are stored in the World of Goo Corporation, a separate level reminiscent of the original prototype the game is based on. There, players can use extra goo balls to build a construction as high as possible. With an online connection, it is possible to view the height of other players. In-game hints are provided through signs that can be clicked and contribute to the story.<br><br>The Wii port supports up to four players simultaneously in cooperative gameplay. The PC port is single-player only but features online leaderboards where players can compare their scores to one another.

Description=The first of many sequels to The Legend Of Zelda. Link has just turned 16, and discovers a strange birthmark on his hand. With the help of Impa, Zelda's nursemaid, Link discovers this mark is the key to unlock a secret room where Princess Zelda lies sleeping. When young, Princess Zelda was given knowledge of the Triforce of power which was used to rule the kingdom of Hyrule, but when a magician unsuccessfully tried to find out about the Triforce from Zelda, he put her into an eternal sleep. In his grief, the prince placed Zelda in this room hoping she may wake some day. He ordered all female children in the royal household to be named Zelda from this point on, so the tragedy would not be forgotten. Now, to bring Princess Zelda back, Link must locate all the pieces of the Triforce which have been hidden throughout the land.<br><br>Each piece of the Triforce is in a temple guarded by a powerful monster which must be defeated. At the same time, Ganon's underlings are still around and gaining in strength and number. It is said Ganon could be brought back to life by sprinkling the blood of the one who defeated him on the ashes (Link!). <br><br>Zelda II: The Adventure of Link is a hybrid action/RPG game. The gameplay alternates between a top-down view (when traveling the land) and side-scrolling perspectives (when fighting, in a temple, or town). In the top-down view, Link cannot do much except for walking: in the side-scrolling action view, however, he can fight, cast spells, collect items and talk to people. <br><br>When Link encounters an enemy in the wilderness, or enters a location which contains enemies, he can fight them with his sword. If Link is at full health, his sword can be thrown, but when he is hurt, he can only fight in melee. Link has a shield which protects him against some of the enemies' attacks if they strike the shield. Touching an enemy or getting hit by their attacks decreases Link's health. Link can replenish his health completely by encountering a fairy in the wilderness, or by using the services of a healer in a town. <br><br>Link also has a "magic" meter. He can cast spells (as long as he learned them first) if he has some magic left. Spells cost a various amount of magic. They have various effects: they cure Link, allow him to jump very high, shoot fireballs etc. Magic can be refilled by collecting blue and red jars sometimes left behind by enemies. <br><br>When Link slays an enemy, it might leave behind an item, or give Link some experience. When Link gains enough experience, he gains a level, which allows him to buy weapon power/maximum magic/maximum health upgrades for his experience points, or he can decide not to buy anything and stockpile his experience points for later use. <br><br>There are some items to be found that are necessary to get past certain points in the game. The Adventure of Link features a battery backup so games can be saved without the need for passwords.

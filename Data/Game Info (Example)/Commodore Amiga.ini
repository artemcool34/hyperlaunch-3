Description=Based around a classic motor car race from either side of the war, 1000 Miglia (literally '1000 miles') is an unusual racing game. You have to progress across Italy through a number of stages in your rickety 20s car. Keeping within time limits at each point is crucial to staying in the game. <br><br>At the beginning of the game, you can choose the spare parts that you will take with yourself in case your car breaks down. You also choose a car and set up the skills for your two drivers; you can distribute points between Skill, Resistance and Mechanics, and choose the driver's favorite part of the race. <br><br>Atmospheric conditions change throughout the race: sometimes the weather will be clear, sometimes you'll have to drive through rain or mist. During the race, your car will sometimes lose a wheel or need other repairs. If this happens, you'll lose a couple of minutes repairing it - as long as you have the appropriate spare part; if you don't have one, it's game over!

Actual sailing is done by plotting a route and then watching the days go by, interrupted only by the occasional random event. Basically you'll be planning routes, watching out for special assignments (that pay well if completed on time) and generally trying to steer clear of the shores of bankruptcy.

The player takes the Anorax' role to find out more.<br><br>The most part of the game is spent on the Nautilus which consists of three rooms: the living room, the control room and the library. There the player can manipulate objects and talk to people to receive hints what to do next and the state of the Nautilus. With the map he influences the route. Sometimes the player leaves the submarine to explore other locations respectively solves puzzles to receive more hints or to solve action sequences, e.g. fighting against a shark. <br><br>The game is played in real-time which means the key to success is being at the right location in the right time. This also results in various possibilities to render the game unwinnable and regular waiting times. The player also needs to watch Nemo's mood, if he angers Nemo, e.g. by manipulating the ship instruments, he locks the player into his room and valuable time passes. The game is played completely in point & click and has no function to save progress.

Or, despite Infogrames' martial marketing efforts, 7 Colors might just be a puzzle game with brightly colored diamonds. <br><br>In the wake of Alexey Pajitnov's block-busting Tetris, Infogrames licensed another Russian mathematician's concept for a game of logics and dexterity: Two players start from opposite ends of a board, filled with rectangles of seven different colors, and take turns in picking one of these colors. All diamonds of that color bordering on the player's territory are annexed, expanding the borders. Whoever first controls more than half of the terrain wins.<br><br>Some quirks add tactical depth: The color chosen is locked for the opponent for one turn; drawing lines from one border of the field to another fills all the space in between. In addition, boards come in various diamond sizes, color textures and with obstacle stones. A (generous) time limit exerts soft pressure.<br><br>7 Colors can be played against the computer or a human opponent, even over a local network - a rare feature at the time. Ambitious players may design their own boards with the included editor.

Description=STORY<br>You play a rookie boxer trying to fight your way to the top. Fight bouts to win money, to pay for your training and manager. Ultimately fighting you way to the title "Champion".<br><br>GAMEPLAY<br>TV Sports Boxing introduces many elements within the game, which among others may be categorized as the following:<br><br>1. Character Creation<br>The "campaign" version in TV Sports: Boxing allows you to start "a new career" of which you have to create a new "human player". Here you can customize your boxer, generally how he looks but more importantly what stats he begins, what style of boxing (ie. Boxer, Brawler, Dancer, Defensive) and which punch packs the most (ie. Jab, Cross, Uppercut). <br><br>Managing Bouts and Training<br>At the "Training Camp" you can meet up with your manager and your trainer. <br><br>The Manager sets up bouts for you to fight in the following month. Managers can only introduce bouts relevant to their "quality" of service. Better managers may be hired as they provide better paying bouts - and higher ranking opponents (though they also ask a higher wage). You must however, fire your current manager first and have adequate funds to hire a new one.<br><br>Each bout pays a certain amount of money. Regardless if you win or lose (minus manager cuts, trainer fees and training camp expenses).<br><br>The Trainer provides you with additional training per month, depending on his/her specialty stat (ie. Power, Stamina, Footwork, etc.) If you continue a successful career, better trainers will appear offering different types of services (which they also ask a higher fee, of course).<br><br>While meeting with the Trainer, you can also purchase equipment to increase your training (stats increase). There are 3 slots available for equipment. Equipment have a certain duration of time (months) expiration before it needs to be replaced.<br><br>Additionally, you can also view your character here, to view monthly stats increase, either obtained by training or by bouts (stats increase are automatic).<br><br>Round 1 - Fight!<br>After you've arranged a bout with your manager, you can enter the appointed bout in the following month. The TV commentator gives comments on "Tale-of-the-Tape" of both boxers before the match begins, as well as the rules of the game.<br><br>The Ring<br>The match starts in a top-down perspective - here you can close in to your opponent and fight face-to-face or you can dance around the ring (usually meant to increase your stamina).<br><br>Boxing<br>The fight itself enters a 3rd person perspective screen (Player 1 on the left, Computer opponent or Player 2 on the right).<br><br>The purpose is of course to weaken your opponent and knock him down! If the stamina bar reaches zero, the opponent falls down. However, if the Head or Body reaches zero, they fall down and don't stand up! Knock Out!<br><br>Being knocked out 3 times in the same round or serious injuries is considered a T.K.O.

The genetic experiments conducted in the prison, combined with a full-scale riot that took place recently, caused all guards and inmates to be transformed into insane, aggressive mutants. Your job is to escape while stopping the genetic plague from transforming the whole world. <br><br>Abuse is a side-scrolling platformer with a lot of shooting. It's a nonlinear game, as the levels often have a few exits that lead to different areas. Your character is a cyborg equipped with various weapons; initially, you only have a weak laser rifle with unlimited ammo, but you can find more powerful guns later on, such as grenade launchers, flamethrowers or lightsabers. You move through a building complex, fighting any enemies you might encounter on the way. The enemies are mostly the mutants, but also the defense systems (such as stationary missile launchers). <br><br>While you move with the keyboard, you can aim with your mouse, so you can shoot at any angle no matter what direction you are running. On your way, you'll find elevators, teleporters, cracked walls that can be destroyed and more. <br><br>Apart from ammo and health, you can also find upgrades which have a number of beneficial effect - increasing your running speed, for example.

Description=Advanced Destroyer Simulator (ADS) is a naval combat simulation set in World War 2. It was the first naval simulation to use real-time filled 3D graphics. Its style and mechanics are reminiscent of Epyx's Destroyer (1986).<br><br>ADS simulates the H.M.S. Onslaught, a British destroyer of the O-class fitted with three cannon turrets, four torpedo tubes on port and starboard respectively, and a sonar to detect and track submarines. In ADS, the Onslaught is not part of a flotilla.<br><br>There's no campaign, gameplay is mission-based and set in three scenarios (two in the CPC version) with five mission each: The Mediterranean around Sicily, the English Channel between UK and France, and the North Sea coast of Norway. Objectives include seek-and-destroy assignments, patrols, convoy escorts, submarine hunts and blockade runs. Each scenario also offers an open “Delta” option where you cruise and hunt without specific objectives.<br><br>You navigate the destroyer manually, in real-time and from a first person perspective, though with the help of a scenario map. ADS simulates ship combat as a close-quarter exchange of torpedoes and cannon fire. In proximity to enemy land bases, Stuka fighters can attack and must be shot down with the cannons. Submarines are tracked with the sonar and can only be attacked once they surface. Enemy vessels include freighters, tankers, torpedo boats, destroyers and cruisers. Most missions are time critical; in the course of the mission, it may be necessary to dock in allied ports for repairs, to refuel and restock on ammunition.

Description=Similar to its predecessor, the premise of After Burner II is to get on the F-14 Tomcat and fly mission after mission of shooting planes out of the sky. At your disposal is a vulcan cannon (basically a machine gun) and a limited number of missiles. In some versions of the game the guns fire automatically all the time. Sometimes you come across a friendly supply plane and if you dock with it you can replenish your missiles.<br><br>The game is viewed from behind the plane with you fighting wave after wave of enemy fighters. But at heart it offers the usual shooter mechanics, meaning you spend most of your time dodging and shooting. You also can speed up and slow down to deal with enemies which appear behind you.

Description=In Air Force Commander the player takes command of a Middle Eastern country's air force to gain air superiority over the enemy. Like the title suggests this game focuses solely on aircraft and rocket bases. The main part of the game is spent on the overhead map where the player gives orders to his units, e.g. attacking ground targets and scouting or intercepting enemy forces. Different map views show information like targets in range, flight movements in the monitored zones or civil facilities. Another important aspect of the game is resource management: every base and unit cost resources. If these get scarce the player can shut down some bases. If the public mood gets too bad, e.g. because of destroyed civil facilities or food shortage, the player loses his commission and therefore the game.

Though you will find new ammo cartridges strewn around the levels, they are consumed quickly by respawning aliens that may come crawling out of the floors and walls when you least expect it. On the floors, you will also find keys for passing through locked doors. Keys must also be used with care, or you may find yourself locked out of a room containing the remaining keys that you will need in order to complete the level. Other doors are one-way, and will electrocute you if you try to pass it in the other direction. <br><br>Other major bonuses found on the floor are emergency kits for restoring your health, and credits. The credits come in handy when you find an Infotex terminal. There, you can access information about your current mission and your vital statistics, as well as buy supplies such as ammunition, weapons and keys.<br><br>Music is forfeited in this game, in favour of ambience sounds from machinery, machine gun sounds and the sounds of the aliens running around the base.

Description=This game consists of ten arcade mini-games based on the Don Bluth animated movie with the main characters voiced by Burt Reynolds and Dom DeLouise. Charlie the dog, a good guy but a bit of a scoundrel, is bumped off by an evil 'crime lord' of a dog and ends up in heaven but yearns to go back to earth to set things right. The game starts there, if you play the story mode. Plot points from the movie are used to loosely tie the mini-games together, but you can also pick your own game. <br><br>Among the different mini-games, there's a Hangman clone, a session of The Towers of Hanoi, a run around the city to try to find the girl's house, a maze-crawl through a ventilation system, and a Rat Race that pits you as a rat called Squad Car trying to win a race against three to five other rats. There are three difficulty levels to choose from.

Description=Ambermoon is the second game in Thalion's never-finished Amber trilogy that was started out by Amberstar. Set more than half a century after the first game, the plot picks up where Amberstar ended. The adventurer who was the protagonist of Amberstar is an old, dying man as the game starts out.<br>He summons his grandchild and tells him about a vision he had, of an old friend who supposedly died more than 40 years ago and warned him of a great evil rising again. He sends the youth on a quest to seek that old friend and find out what is behind that vision...<br><br>Concerning gameplay, Ambermoon is very similar to Amberstar, with a top-down view map and some first-person sequences - the latter now not being a Dungeon Master-ish "step-by-step" first-person as in the first game, but a real 3D engine, even with textured floors and ceilings. Combat is still turn-based with characters moving in a grid. Put short, gameplay is textbook old-school fantasy RPG.<br>People who've played the first game will most probably feel very at home as the interface is pretty much identical to that of Amberstar; moving is done with the number pad and toggling the pad keys between movement and actions (look at, talk to, use etc) with the enter key. The same can be achieved with the mouse; left-clicking a button performs the corresponding action while right-clicking toggles movement/action modes.

Stacks of coloured bricks are arranged in patterns above. The object is being to bounce a ball to hit the bricks to make them disappear. Some bricks’ require multiple hits to destroy - visually indicated by dots shown on the face.  Some special bricks are distinguished from others by unique icons, e.g. one with a’ skull’ will result in a loss of life if hit by the ball, or one with an ‘x’ mark will cause new bricks to spawn & spread.  <br><br>At times bricks will yield colour-coded pickups which topple down and may be caught, resulting in a special power-up feature being given. A unique play facet presented here is that power-ups’ are not activated automatically, but rather are reserved - The player may utilise the last power-up collected upon clicking the right mouse button, this remains true even if a ball is lost.

At random intervals it will start to glow, meaning that it's about to explode.

Description=The Amiga Software Extra Nr. 12 is a Markt & Technik compilation of three low-budget games developed in Germany that were never released elsewhere. The following games are included:<br><br>1) Highway 42<br><br>The player assumes the role of a young car courier, trying to make a life by doing freight jobs. So, the basic gameplay of Highway 42 is driving from city to city in search for new assignments, where the driving part is designed as a simple racing game and the city visits as text menus, and completing these jobs for money. The earned money should be spent on fuel and car repair firstly, an surplus can be used to upgrade the car. From time to time the player can accept a quest that's mostly of the bounty-hunt or fetch-that-item kind. Furthermore, there's cities in the game world where young promising pilots can participate in price races. As these races can be dangerous and the streets out there are so, the car can be equipped with weaponry, too.<br><br>2) Warlords<br><br>Although wearing a more or less famous name, Warlords is a simple two-player board game that's not to be confused with the successful fantasy strategy franchise. The game can be played by one human player versus the computer with four difficulty levels available. Two human players can engage via hot seat option.<br><br>Gameplay itself is a stripped-down checkers variant with twelve stones each that takes place on an 8x8 board. Target of the game is to bring one stone to the other player's base line. Warlords also features a board editor.<br>  <br><br>3) Zargon<br><br>The player controls a green fighter jet from top-down that is free to fly over the whole vertically scrolling screen, but can shoot only in the scrolling direction. Besides avoiding or shooting the enemy sprites, three power-ups can be collected, namely extra lives, extra points and better ammo. When the player's jet hits an enemy or is being hit by enemy bullets, it will instantly fall back to the weakest ammunition.<br><br>The game offers only three military/naval themed background sets and one single (long) set of enemy waves, both of which are constantly repeating. The enemies are a wild mingle-mangle of objects that do not fit into a certain theme. There are hamburgers, skulls, fighter planes, satellites, coke cans and many more to fight. Furthermore, Zargon differs from other shooters in that there are no boss fights, and gameplay has no end except the player dying. Target of the game, instead, is to collect as many points as possible for an entry in the high score list.<br><br>As many Amiga action games of that time, Zargon also offers two player gameplay, here the second player controls an additional green fighter jet on the same screen.

Description=The Amiga Spiele 1 is a Markt & Technik compilation of three low-budget games developed in Germany that were never released elsewhere. The following games are included:<br><br>1) Wikinger<br><br>As the name suggests, Wikinger is a strategical conquest game taking place in Northern Europe around 900 A.D.. The initial choice to be made is how many human players shall participate, the number ranges from five people down to zero with the latter option boiling down to watching five computer-controlled players battle it out. Of course, there are precisely five nations to choose from that are in desperate need of a leader, namely Iceland, England, Sweden, Denmark, and Norway. As the goal of the game is to conquer as much land as possible, Iceland is, for geographical reasons, by far the hardest nation to succeed with, where Denmark is the easiest.<br><br>Every nation starts the game with one single staging post that controls 10 villages. From this point forward, the most important thing is to raise some viking armies to conquer new lands which will increase the people count and, thus, the player's income. Not later than the first meeting with foreign armies, the player should have built up a working economy that will exemplarily enable him to equip his armies with weaponry and boating, build new staging posts that will harden his defense, or buy additional  wheat to compensate for bad harvests. The latter combined with a low tax rate will significantly increase the young nation's head count.<br><br>2) Gölzy's Bliff (aka Bliff)<br><br>Bliff is a simple billiard adaption with one cue ball, one other ball and one pocket. Goal of the game is to pot the other ball using the cue ball which gives the single player mode a decent feeling of minigolf, a feat also amplified by the different loadable tables that come with the game. There is a two player hot-seat mode, too, where every player has to pot the other player's ball. Furthermore, the player can design his own tables and save them to disc, thus being able to share them with fellow players.<br><br>3) Quadriga<br><br>Quadriga is a computer adaption of the popular strategy game Connect Four. Two players are to assign stones to a 7x7 board with each player's goal of connecting four of them horizontally, vertically or diagonally, while hindering the other player in doing so. The game can be played by one or two human players with the artificial intelligence of the possible computer player coming with five different IQ's. It is even possible to let two computer players battle it out, testing whether the higher difficulty levels really play better than the lower ones in the process.

The polar ice caps have melted, turning the surface of the earth into many islands of decaying land masses, known as Archipelagos. Man then built systems to try to clean up the pollution, but these failed. The only life left were genetically-altered plants made in an effort to clean up the waste -- these also turned hostile. It is up to you to clean up the earth, island by island.  <br><br>Controlling a hoversphere, it is up to you to make Earth's many islands of land habitable. To do this, you need to knock out the radiation generators on each island, which can be done by knocking out each generator's power sources (there are several per island). Once these are knocked out, you have 90 seconds to get back to the generator and disable it before it melts down, taking you with it.<br><br>Obstacles, unfortunately for you, are plentiful: You can't knock out a power source unless it is connected by a "land bridge" to the generator. You have the ability to create land where needed, but this takes up energy, and you have a limited supply. Also a hindrance are the many genetically-altered entities left behind on the islands: Viral trees that poison the ground; necromancers (former hoverspheres) that now erode land instead of creating it; eco eggs that explode on touch; and aircleaners, who are ruthlessly efficient in cleaning up the air -- and everything else, including you.<br><br>The entire game plays from a 3D first-person viewpoint. A movable cursor selects where to move or what to manipulate.<br><br>There are 10,000 islands on Earth to purify. If you can make it past Archipelago #100, you are then free to select any of them.

Description=The sequel to the classic Archon, Archon II: Adept features a more complex board and enhanced gameplay.<br><br>Each side plays as an Adept - a powerful wizard with the ability to cast spells against other Adepts and his summonings - and must defeat the other side, either Chaos or Order, by attacking him/her with summoned Elementals or Demons. Each side can summon 4 unique elementals at a time or choose from 4 demons, common to both.<br><br>Gameplay is similar to the original, reminiscent of a chess-like board game, requiring strategy, but with arcade elements, especially when two adepts confront each other face-to-face. The board also shifts from time to time, making the strategy less predictable.

Description=Archon: The Light and the Dark is a strategic board game with some similarities to chess. Two sides, a light one and a dark one, consisting of 18 pieces each compete on a board divided into (9 by 9) squares. You win the game by having one of your units on each of the five powerpoint squares or by removing all opposing pieces from the board. <br><br>However, you can't just remove a piece from the board by landing on it. When two pieces clash, the outcome is decided in the battle arena during one-on-one real-time combat (just like in Star Control, also by Paul Reiche III). If the real-time combat takes place on a dark square, the dark monster gets a health bonus (longer life bar). On a light square the light side gains an advantage. There are also some squares whose color changes over time (from afternoon, to dusk, to night, to dawn etc.), which adds an extra layer of strategy to the game.<br><br>Unlike chess the two sides are not identical. Both sides consist of mythological creatures. For example the light side has among others unicorns, valkyries and a djinni while the dark side features basilisks, banshees and manticores. The differences are not just cosmetic. Two special pieces are the light wizard & the dark sorceress, they can both cast magical spells like: imprison a unit on the board, shift the flow of time (change day/night cycle to your advantage), bring one unit back from the dead etc.<br><br>The different pieces have their own movement restrictions regarding the number of squares they're allowed to travel on the board and whether or not they can jump over other units (like the knight in chess). Units also behave different in combat; some units are faster than others, some use melee attacks while others fire projectiles.<br><br>Archon can be played with either one or two players.<br>The NES version, which was released a few years after the other versions, has improved graphics for the real-time combat part. Each type of square has it's own colored background and the unit sprites are larger.

Description=The original Breakout concept involves controlling a bat at the bottom of the screen and using it to catch and direct a ball so as to hit all the bricks which are arranged at the top of the screen. It was unpopular for over a decade, before Taito revived it with some new ideas in this arcade game.<br><br>The game's plot redefines the bat as a Vaus spaceship, the ball as an energy bolt, and the bricks form a mysterious wall stopping the ship from progressing to safety.<br><br>By the mid-80s, power-ups were popular in most types of arcade games, and Arkanoid features them. They are caught by positioning the bat below them as they fall (meaning that you risk missing the ball if you go for them at the wrong time). The power-ups include lasers (which are mounted to each side of the ship and allow you to shoot out the blocks), a catching device (so as to be able to fire the ball off at a different angle every time you hit it) and one that slows the ball.... sorry, bolt.... down. Needless to say, the game inspired tonnes of clones, few of which added anything else.

The way the level layouts change as you play allows you to potentially box in some enemies, so you can deal with them gradually.<br><br>There are also exploding bad guys (drawn as Lemmings), so watch out for the warning as they prepare. Some blocks are icy, meaning that they can’t be pushed, and they destroy any block that hits them. Collectible power ups include a short-term baddy-freeze and short-term invincibility. There’s a co-operative 2-player mode, in which you can, unusually, harm your team-mate.<br><br>An extremely sophisticated editor was tucked away in the game, allowing you to not only design a maze and position the baddies (including regenerating ones, set to come in at any interval), but also change their speed and how frequently they fire hazards out

Description=You play the part of the head of a railroad company, with the aim of creating your own railroad empire, providing a successful mass transit system that will be an inspiration to the rest of the world. Another goal is to provide the impetus for your chosen city to develop. There are a number of different places to set up business each with different layouts and existing houses and businesses.<br><br>The main money earners are passenger trains, that can be scheduled to pick up passengers at the times of day when the demand is high. However, in the long term you need the city to develop. This requires setting up trains that transport resources to where they are needed. These resources are used to build houses, and other buildings, increasing the number of passengers for your commuter trains.<br><br>As the city develops, new businesses will spring up, such as stadiums, high rise office blocks, and ski resorts. You can also build your own businesses, the success of which will depend on the local population, the presence of competing businesses, and even the changes of the seasons, among other factors.    <br><br>The stock market is also another way of making money. You can also watch the seasons come and go, with snow visible in winter, and fireworks displays celebrating the new year.

Though the game is superficially similar to R-Type, it features a different level layout (only one level to fit into 32 kilobytes) and different playmechanics. Your ship has autofire, and the enemies, while rather stupid, can absorb a lot of shots. The weapon upgrade pods are there, but you lack R-Type's famous "Force" as well as the charged power shots. The game does not end with a boss battle, instead the level shrinks until you crash into a greeting message!

However, it is now 1989, and the Communist Block is crumbling...<br><br>Chris Crawford, who rarely ever made a sequel to a computer game, was besieged by mail asking him to update his classic from a few years before to reflect the new state of the world. Russia was falling, the Iron Curtain was shattering, and smaller countries were beginning to assert their own regional power with more freedom from the bipolar world of the Cold War.<br><br>The result was the 1990 Edition. This game featured an updated database, but the most significant new features were:<br><br>1. The multipolar level, where small countries could go to war with their neighbors on their own. Of course, you could help them out (or encourage them!) by sending in military aid.<br><br>18 more countries, bringing the total to 80.<br><br>A "Crisis Advisory Board" of four people, who would give you advice during international crises. The nice thing about being a Superpower is that the little countries do whatever you tell them, but you still have to watch out for your main rivals (USSR or the US)!

Description=This puzzle game features four players, any number of which can be human or computer, and is viewed from an isometric perspective. The basic gameplay is very similar to Virgin's Spot license. Your aim is to take control of the largest area of the board, which is done by moving your pieces so as for them to be next to pieces of another colour, which will then become your colour. There are three types of move – short moves which also see you retain the square you were in, jumps in which you lose the previous square, and moves using the teleporting device to move a larger distance. There are over 100 levels, which needn't be played in sequence. The board layouts feature gaps in, which must be incorporated into your strategy, to ensure that you don't leave a space next to a large number of your pieces, which would allow an opponent to swallow them up.

After a certain period of time a ‘hurry up’ message appears, causing water to flood the level – this is expanded from Rainbow Islands because the water takes longer to flow through densely-platformed areas, and a reflection effect is visible.

Gameplay is unchanged, with batting involving precise timing and stroke selection, and bowling involving waggling to set speed or spin, with control over where the ball pitches.

Description=This sequel to Dark Castle has our formerly nameless hero now known as Prince Duncan continuing his adventures after he toppled the Black Knight's throne and was dropped by a gargoyle in Trouble 3. With Merlin's help, Prince Duncan finds his way behind the Black Knight's throne where there is a fireplace and mantle. At the start of each new game, Duncan tries to take a torch on the wall beside the fireplace, and the entire wall spins around to reveal a large Ante Room containing 5 pedestals for holding orbs. Your mission is to collect all 5 orbs to open a gate to lead you to a final duel with The Black Knight.  <br><br>This game has similar gameplay and 15 new levels - five of which scroll as opposed to the static screens of the past.  These 5 are: Swamp, Black Forest, East Labyrinth, West Labyrinth, and Black Knight's Showdown & The Final Battle.  There are different enemies and items such as multiple keys and a helicopter pack which lets you fly in the Swamp and Black Forest levels.  You must pick up Gas to use it also.   The game map is larger with longer levels.  Different elements present include  weapons-based fighting, mazes, bombs which are used to destroy enemies or walls, and a health system.  <br><br>Some enemies will decrease your health when hitting you instead of killing you outright. Elixirs will protect your health but it will also deplete slowly over time and can be restored by picking up food or leaving the level. There is now the option to save your game but it must be done from one of the computers in the castle's Computer Room.  There's also a new practice mode to try out levels.  When playing in Advanced mode, there's a different ending to the game than normal.

Completely mouse-controlled, the game is divided in a series of non-scrolling screens, each one being a puzzle. The main objective is to move an anthropomorphic tomato from the left side of the screen to a conveyor belt on the right side. Several objects hinder progress by squishing, perforating, exploding and destroying the tomatoes. The player has an infinite number of them, but a time constraint is in place: a timer runs in the bottom left of the screen. The tomato movement can be started and stopped by clicking a semaphore on the bottom of the screen (the screen objects move independently, with their own timing). In order to solve the levels, you pick various gadgets at the bottom of the screen and place them according to your strategy. These gadgets are:<br><br>? An electric fan that can boost and alter your tomato's trajectory;<br><br>? A trampoline where the tomato can bounce and reach new heights;<br><br>? A Jack-In-The-Box to eject the tomato upwards;<br><br>? A blocking box to stop the tomato's movement.

Description=The world has been enslaved by Murk, and you've got to free it by collecting the seven fragments of a tablet which are in the possession of seven wizards who inhabit seven towers.<br><br>Blade Warrior is a unique game in two ways, the most obvious being the graphics. Everything in this game is seen in silhouette - as you wander around looking for magical items and killing baddies, all you see is your silhouette and the silhouette of everything around you. The background is made up of a night sky, with clouds and hills.<br><br>Secondly, the game is an unusual mix of adventuring and battling. On your way to collecting magical items and exploring the huge ingame map, you're assaulted by baddies. Then, once you have collected certain artifacts, you can conjure up spells (so long as you have the recipe) back in your tower, trade with wizards for those all important tablet pieces and get clues to the next important artifacts.

Description=In the late nineties, when the devil and his aunt was making a Dynablaster clone, you had to make it really special to stand out. A British team certainly did it, and the game is one testament to the power of Blitz Basic (developed by Acid Software).<br><br>As in all Bomberman-type games, you and a number of other players are put in a maze, where you must blow away bits of the maze with bombs in order to reveal power-ups and make a path towards your enemies which you must blow up. BlitzBombers has its fair share of power-ups, ranging from the ubiquitous extra bombing range and extra bombs bonuses to light bulbs which either obscure the playfield or make it so bright that you cannot navigate. Another powerup grants you real invisibility, so that you may sneak up on your friends. Even more useful is the invincibility item.<br><br>A particular power-up allows you to play a sub-game, of which there are four:<br><br>1. PakAttack: The player who picks up the sub-game power-up is Pac-man, and the others are ghosts for him to eat up. The usual yellow dots and power-pills are of course also there.<br>BombShoot: You must shoot all bombs except for your own.<br>ShieldSearch: A golden shield is hidden on the level, the finder wins.<br>Tag: One player is "it", and must pass "it" on to another player before the time runs out.<br><br>The winner of a sub-game gets to inflict a power-up of his choice on his adversaries.<br><br>Unlike many other PD Dynablaster games, BlitzBombers has both a working one-player (adventure) mode with over a hundred levels, as well as the usual multi-player game, played either for a set number of matches (grudge match) or until everyone simply gets tired. It also has a working AI, so that computer players may fill empty chairs.<br><br>While most of the game is played in lo-res (320x256), the game can switch to hi-res (640x256) mode, so as to fit in more on-screen. This becomes necessary when the number of players rises above four, which is a possibility since this game supports not only the usual four-player adaptor supplied with Dynablaster, but also null-modem hook-up, so that up to eight players can participate at once.

By rotating the joystick, the player moves the landscape so that Bob moves over the coins and finds the exit. <br><br>The levels include many spikes, contact with which causes the loss of coins; if the player has no coins when contact is made, it's game over. Some level designs are fiendish, with lots of corridors and alleyways, teleports, and bricks to break through (by building up enough momentum).<br><br>There are a host of special 'power-ups' across the level as well. The simplest ones (and the first ones the player will meet) change the direction of gravity, causing the player's character to automatically 'fall' to the left when not in motion. Others include a sticky mode where Bob stops bouncing (unless the player presses the fire button), a heavier-bounce mode, and a very useful one allowing the player to 'thrust' Bob around, ideal for reaching precariously-placed coins.<br><br>Once the player reaches level 51 a further twist is added - Bob's body starts in a separate point of the level, and this must also be coaxed to the exit. The view always centers on Bob's head, even once this is in the exit, so the player will have to use the scanner alone to guide the body across - knowing that a move which benefits one can drag the other off course.

Description=BOH is a top-down shooter with retro graphics and sound, somewhat comparable to Alien Breed.<br><br>As a member of the Resistance it is the player's goal to repel an invasion of unknown beings. These beings, ranging from bugs to robots to zombies (and more), will spawn indefinitely until the player finds the "Evil Masters", which have to be defeated to complete the missions. To accomplish this task one can find better weapons, shield recharges, enemy detectors and pieces of equipment, such as automappers, light sources and a 360° visor, which, due to initially limited field of vision and illumination, are essential to navigate the labyrinths which missions take place in. Exploration, indeed, represents the game's core.<br><br>Missions are entirely stand-alone, so, except for secret missions not yet unlocked, the player is allowed to select any mission he/she would like to play from the main menu. Some missions are multi-phase, meaning that the player has to complete in strict sequence the phases they are subdivided into. Each mission has a difficulty rating - the higher the difficulty the more complex its labyrinth(s) will be.<br><br>A notable aspect of the game is the fact that the setting can be completely redefined by means of themes - at the time of writing, there are 6 themes that render sci-fi/alien, medieval, underground and pseudo-vectorial environments.

Some updates can make you walk through the walls, increase your speed, and give you some other assets to aid you in your quest to save the woman you love.<br><br>This top-down action-arcade game consists of nine levels per stage, each tougher than the other, and each final consisting of the boss you'll have to deal with. You can move horizontally and vertically and lay down bombs behind you thus evaporating the enemies, but beware, 'cos you can block yourself with your own bomb, and become a victim of your own tricks if you'll play in a huff.

Squad members advance and act in turn on basis of a movement point system. <br><br>The multi-level maps consist of outside terrain and structures with several stories, connected by lifts, filled with enemies and objects. Squad members can find and use weapons such as grenades, rockets or detonation packs and tools such as Medikits, scanners or shields.<br><br>In an unique twist, the squad leader advances from mission to mission (while the rest of the team is always new), improving his basic stats with each successfully completed assignment, based on his performance. Only experienced leaders may attempt STAR-rated scenarios. If the squad leader gets killed, he is lost forever: the game deletes the corresponding leader file.

Bonus and non-bonus items appear on the pitch, such as bombs to throw at opponents, rabbits to speed up the current player, or tortoises to slow him down. <br><br>Teams consist of humans and aliens, many of which have their own unique skills. There's a lot of blood and flailing limbs, giving things a gruesomely humorous edge. There are four leagues to progress through, plus a knockout cup and single matches.

Melba is an easy-going guitar player who is having a picnic with his girlfriend; suddenly, an ultra-strong, evil-looking character appears and kidnaps the poor girl, sailing away on his ship. The brave Melba swims after the ship, and finds a bottle with a map inside. Knowing now the way to the evil kidnapper's lair, Melba embarks on a journey without further hesitation!<br><br>The premise, the map with the "stages", and the side-scrolling view indicate a platform-type action game; in reality, however, Builderland is a puzzle game, somewhat similar to the famous  Lemmings. As in Lemmings, the player has no control over the protagonist himself (except on a few occasions, when "boss" enemies must be defeated by throwing certain objects at them). Instead, the player must manipulate the environment in order to build a path for Melba, deal with the enemies, etc. Melba is for the most part entirely helpless and simply walks forward automatically. Various items such as boxes, weapons, platforms, etc., must be collected and placed properly in order to save the hero from premature death.

The red balls must be hit once and the colored balls four times (doubles and trebles count as two and three hits respectively.) Play follows snooker in that after a red ball is potted a color must be attempted, hitting a ball out of sequence ends a turn and forfeits points etc. The player with the highest score wins.

With a back catalog of several installments of the then-leading world atlas and almanac software, PC Globe, the company turned snippets of country-specific info into an educational game that mixed two-player “Identify that place” strategy with a “Get to know the globe” learning effect – can you say Carmen Sandiego?<br><br>As the sinister Otto von Slinkenrat tries to pocket the world’s treasures in his private collection, renowned adventurer Bush Buck sets out to find and secure the valuable objects for posterity. In a race around the globe, you and an opponent travel back and forth between 206 cities in 175 countries in search for clues to the treasures’ whereabouts. Cities are connected by a network of plane routes; players take turns in jetting from one destination to the next. On each visit to a city, you learn some background info – e.g. about landmarks, geography, culture.<br><br>Learning to place countries and cities on the globe is essential to finding the treasures, which are all linked to a specific place on Earth. If you know that a Samisen is a Japanese musical instrument, for example, you can make your way directly to Tokyo; if not, a set of clues that you collect on your travels will point out features of the target country and town which help narrow down your options – e.g. “It’s an island country”, “It’s in East Asia” etc. The first player to visit the target town collects the treasure and has to return it to his home base for a points reward.<br><br>For each game, the computer selects 15 out of 400 possible objects; if all are found or if both players run out of plane tickets (each flight costs one ticket), the game ends and whoever has amassed the most points wins. Three difficulty levels increase the AI strength and reduce helpful hints, making Bush Buck a challenge even for experienced globe trotters.

Description=Intelligence reports suggest that POWs have been captured and are being held hostage at the guerilla outpost on Butcher Hill. The game is divided into three sections. <br><br>In the first section, players steer their dinghy along a river while avoiding mines and other obstacles. If the dinghy comes into contact with any mine, it explodes. However, when the player has collected ammo, the mines can be destroyed. Coming into contact with rocks causes the dinghy to bounce out of the water for a short distance. When a jetty appears, pressing the fire button allows the player to land and start the next section.<br><br>The second section has the player finding their way through dense jungle whose path lead to the enemy camp at the base of Butcher Hill. Stopping you from proceeding are soldiers that have orders to shoot you on sight. Mines are also scattered around the jungle floor and must be avoided. If players were able to obtain a compass in the first section, their current direction will be displayed at the right of the control panel. Shooting all the soldiers in the jungle gives the player extra ammunition and stamina.  <br><br>In the final section, players need to destroy the enemy camp by blowing up huts with bullets or grenades. While they are doing that, they must also be on the lookout for any soldiers that tries to leave the camp to bring back more soldiers.

Your task is to build, test and deploy a network of laser defense satellites before the Russians manage to do so. In this time of crisis, however, all your actions are overshadowed by the threat of espionage and treachery. The scientists that you hire may be geniuses, but are they trustworthy? The more technology tests you schedule, the easier it is for Russian spies to steal your knowledge. If you tighten up security on the other hand, the overprotection will throttle research efficiency. As you race against time and an invisible enemy, the word "paranoia" gains a whole new quality.<br><br>Luckily, the counter-intelligence department is at your command, too. CIA agents in Moscow not only supply you with information on the Soviet project's progress, but also on KGB operations in the USA. How accurate the reports are, however, is for you to judge. You must also supply the Afghan warlords Archer with weapons and equipment, as only he can launch a desperate attack on the Bright Star base that will hopefully throw back the Soviet project for months.

Description=Carrier Command was one of the first real-time strategy games.<br><br>You control an advanced cybernetic aircraft carrier complete with fighters, amphibious assault vehicles, laser defenses and a fleet of decoy drones.  Your mission is to build a series of resource, factory, and defensive bases spanning an island chain.  The only problem?  At the other end of the chain is an even more advanced carrier under control of a terrorist organization with the same mission.<br><br>As you move around the islands you must decide what facilities to build and where they will best support your advance.  Resource islands provide materials that factory islands can use to build weapons and vehicles to replace your combat losses but both will be quickly overrun if the enemy attacks them while you are not present.  You also have to ensure that your stockpiles of equipment are stored safely until you can find time to launch a resupply drone to bring them to your carrier.<br><br>From your carrier, you can take first person control of your attack aircraft and amphibious tanks and use them to assault enemy islands or even the enemy carrier itself if you're lucky enough to find it.  The weapon payloads on your vehicles are completely configurable based on your needs.  An island invasion may require launching a virus bomb that will take over the enemy command systems or just blasting the base with a wire guided surface to surface missile.<br><br>Ultimately, you have to find and destroy the enemy carrier but, doing so will require a solid supply infrastructure and a strategy for depriving your opponent of his.

Description=Defending the ancient Carthagean Empire from Roman invasion is your challenge in this arcade-strategy fusion.<br><br>Your armies can be supported by catapult and elephant-mounted units, but only if these are already available and you find them first (building doesn't really come into play). Guarding the hills also gives you an advantage in combat.<br><br>Each unit becomes more skilled and happy if they win battles, but fatigue comes into play if they fight too frequently. You need to pay for the soldiers, which is done by producing goods to trade.<br><br>Actually distributing the cash appropriately involves transporting it via Chariots, which improbably leads to an arcade racing-type sequence in which you must avoid not only rocks and trees, but also Roman chariots (why they are heading in the same direction as you every single time needs explanation) - contact loses you money.

This is represented as an action mini-game, depicting a duel of the flagships; however, the outcome of the battle actually depends on the strength of your fleet.

Despite the fact that the game consists purely of statistics and tables and no graphics at all, it's extremely addictive, and you cannot avoid not getting hooked if you're a footie fanatic. <br><br>Boasting endless features and an enormous depth, CM2 is just like managing an own, personal football team from the comfort of your own living room. Literally every famous and semi-famous player from all around the globe is featured, and it's of course possible to transfer players to and from your squad in your neverending quest for the ultimate line-up. <br><br>The game is controlled by solely using the mouse, and the menus don't contain icons or any flashy graphics -- it rather goes for informative and in-your-face text boxes, CM-style. During matches, explanatory text explains you what happens through use of the same text boxes, and you can of course modify your team just like you want to, and use the tactics of your choice. If you find that playing with only the English and Scottish leagues somewhat weakens your interest, you'll be pleased to discover that several foreign add-ons or stand-alone games are available. Once you get addicted, you'll find that you'll spend enormous amounts of time in front of your pc, and you'll get somewhat disappointed when you discover that it's impossible to play any further than 2025. Trust me, I've been there.

Description=The year is 2469. Six months ago the Earth was plunged into thermonuclear war and 96% of its population was wiped out in a matter of hours. What was left were hit by radiation poison and mutated unspeakably, and left to live as savages. Ironically the only civilized areas left on the earth were controlled by the government which started the war, CY-COR. Realizing the advantage they held over the world they took it upon themselves to wipe out what was left of humankind. For this purpose the CY-COR mutation "cleansers" were created. Their job was to get rid of whatever the bombs left behind. Fortunately a faction of these cleaners rebelled against CY-COR in an attempt to right the wrongs CY-COR had done to the planet. As the leader of the rebellion you must overthrow the CY-COR government by invading their headquarters. Caution must be taken however as their base is heavily guarded and the surrounding landscapes are dangerous. The only way to gain access into the fortress is by finding 4 crystal keys. Without these the world is surely doomed.<br><br>Champions of Dawn is a freeware RPG for the Amiga similar to Dungeon Master, with some Doom FPS elements. Like that RPG game, it is controlled by mouse and keyboard. On the screen is a box with six arrows in it. Clicking on these moves forward, backward, left, right or turn. The keyboard can also be used to control the movements. Pressing the right mouse button brings up the inventory, where objects found can be stored on slots. Besides these slots, there is a mouth icon. Dropping food items on it nourishes the character. Below the mouth, two hands surrounding a black square. Placing weapons on this square activates them. Guns are fired by clicking the left mouse button. At the top of the screen there are two yellow bars. The first one is health, the second is ammunition. Food consumption and the use of health kits boosts the former, while ammunition clips increase the latter.

When you run out of balls, which is more probable the more balls that are on-screen, the game is over. Nevertheless, launching several balls at once yields higher scores in accordance with the higher difficulty level.

Description=In the game you play Hen House Harry who has to collect 12 (a dozen) eggs from each level, while avoiding the ducklings.  The levels each occupy a single screen, and are made up of platforms, ladders and lifts (or elevators), and are thus similar to those in classic platform game Donkey Kong.  Corn can also be collected, which stops the time limit from ticking down and also stops the bonus, collected when the level is completed, from decreasing.  The ducklings also eat the corn, however.<br><br>There are only 8 distinct levels.  The ninth level is a copy of level 1, the tenth is a copy of level 2, and so on.  However, on the second time around the ducklings that can use the platforms and ladders are replaced by the Mother Duck, who can fly around the level going through the platforms and ladders.  On the third time around, you have to face both the Mother Duck and the ducklings, and similarly on subsequent goes round, when there are more ducklings.

You get an extra 80 seconds for completing each level though.<br><br>The levels feature all manner of further hazards - there are holes in the ground to avoid falling through (some visible, some hidden), arrows which force the ball in a particular direction, slippery squares making any movement's effect exaggerated, magneted squares making it impossible to jump from, and many more. Fortunately lots of power-ups, time boosts and bonus fruits are dropped onto the levels at random intervals as well.<br><br>To complete the game you must clear 8 levels, and the structure is non-linear - initially you have a choice of 4 levels, and after completing one of those you have a choice of 4 more levels (which are different depending on which level you completed first).

You may switch between your four soldiers at any time, while the inactive ones regenerate their health.

Description=In this puzzle game you have to match a predefined colored pattern so that you fill a certain percentage with the rotatable fragments you have before you run out of matching fragments.<br><br>For example, in level 1 you have a 12x12 square, whereby the outer ring is purple, then blue, then red, then green, and finally a yellow block in the center.<br><br>Now you have a fragment for placing into the square, which you can rotate in any of the four directions. Once you placed it, those colored blocks will become gray and can't be used anymore. This also means that the next fragment must be placed totally into the colored area, overlapping isn't possible. And of course, you can only place them in a matching area of colored blocks.<br><br>And here comes the problem. Those fragments aren't just a square, they can be in unusual complex forms, and you have to carefully think where to place them, because once set, they can't be removed. And on top of this, you only have a few seconds to think. If the timer for a fragment runs to zero, you get a new fragment, but only if you have a bomb remaining, which is used when the time runs out. When you start a level, you have 5 bombs available.<br><br>Good news are that you normally don't have to fill all blocks, before you start the level, the game will tell you how much, in percent, you have to fill.<br><br>The game offers 100 different levels, one more complex then the other. This means, that the basic geometric figure will be more complex, but also the colored patterns inside the figure.<br><br>After completing a level, you get a level code for the following level, so you don't have to play all 100 levels in one row.

The ten cities must be occupied to win, you do this by forming armies to defend your five cities and attack those of your opponent. When a city is taken, any mobile army that came from that city is automatically disbanded. In this way, potentially overwhelming forces can be routed by conquering their cities -- but only if you can conquer the city before its army reaches its target. Depending on how the cities are located at the start of the game, you may find this to be a key part of your campaign strategy. When armies battle, the game switches from the strategic map, to a tactical one. Formations, unit orders, and moral are factors in the tactical battles.

Professor Renegade was last seen in the unexplored region of the highest Tibetan ranges; an area populated by creatures and conditions of the professor's own design: venomous stone snakes, reptilian birds, and acid storms. Not only must your Adventurer survive these tests of courage, but he must and properly use such curious objects as spurs, a vacuum cleaner, and a unicycle.<br>Once you locate the professor and convince him to help, you'll need to help him construct an anti-asteroid deflector to prevent the destruction of earth. You must now search for high-tech tools such as an atomic pile, a 9-volt battery, and a bent coat hanger!<br><br>Use the joystick and the appropriate keys to maneuver the Adventurer across the landscape. You have 30 days to complete the mission. During the mission, the Adventurer collects various items (points are awarded for each). Some items serve little purpose; others are vital; and others only work in certain places. Only one item can be held at a time and it must be held to be used. Native bearers carry the items collected. <br><br>To look at what each bearer has, type 1 or 2 to scroll through the bearers. The Adventurer can exchange the item held (press S) with a bearer that is closest to him. Its trial and error time. Good luck. The game comes with cheats and a map for those that require a little help.

Description=Linus had crash landed on a distant planet called Earth, and made his way back home again. Trouble is, no one believes his tale of the planet he discovered! Your job is to help Linus make his way back to planet Earth so he can take some pictures to convince his friends. Gameplay consists of two parts, an adventure and arcade action. In adventure mode you can explore lands, find objects, and talk to people. Sentences can be constructed by using the pointer to select actions or objects on the screen (This is similar to the interface LucasArts used in games such as Maniac Mansion.) To reach many new locations involves the action mode, where you will need to cross treacherous landscapes and evade dangerous creatures. This portion resembles a side scrolling platform game. Once you've cleared an action sequence, you will not need to do so again if you decide to revisit a location. Whenever you wish you can receive a password allowing you to continue the game later from the same point.

You must gather more essential supplies, but more importantly, you must disarm the reactor before it self-destructs. You have the key, but where is the reactor? Once this step of your mission has been done, you must make your way back out while trying to get past the alien attack droids, acid leaks, and more vicious beastoids. The final phase is to destroy the Creature which is underground at the lunar station. You soon discover that it cannot be destroyed by your current weapons. While fending of the Creature, you must look for more provisions and the explosives needed to destroy the teleportation unit the Creature will otherwise use to send for more of his own kind. Queen Creatures will try to prevent your success. Once collected, place the explosives by the unit and set the timer.

Description=Cruise for a Corpse is a graphic adventure game with a point-and-click interface.<br><br>1927. When Inspector Raoul Dusentier is invited to a cruise upon a mighty sailing ship by the wealthy businessman Niklos Karaboudjan, he looks forward to nothing but a relaxing week on the sea. Instead, his host manages to get himself killed on the second day. Murdered, to be exact. Too convenient that a policeman is aboard -- Dusentier sets out to search for suspects. He doesn't need to search long. Why is it that none of the family members seem awfully sad about the demise of the old man? Is the mysterious Father Fabiani really as pious as he says? In the best tradition of Agatha Christie, each and every person on board has a motive for the murder.<br><br>You advance in the plot not so much by solving common object-based puzzles, but by talking to the right persons about the right subjects at the right time, thus collecting clues. You will also find pieces of evidence scattered throughout the ship. However, most items suddenly appear in cupboards and drawers that were previously empty -- an awfully unnerving process. The clock advances in ten-minute-steps whenever you discover an interesting clue, which conveniently informs you of your progress. The protagonists move around the ship; so whenever time passes, different persons to talk to might appear at certain locations.<br><br>With Cruise for a corpse, Delphines Cinematique interface reached &quot;Evolution 2&quot;. Instead of containing a fixed number of verbs, the command menu is now context-sensitive. The mouse cursor will change its appearance when moved over an interesting object; a left-click brings up a set of appropriate verbs. For example, a cupboard may be opened and searched, whereas a key can be picked up and turned. A right-click accesses the inventory. Another interesting improvement: All the persons in the game are animated polygons (see Trivia).

And who would be better suited to rid Enchantia of the sorceress than a tender teen? Well? A heavily armed mercenary? Yeah, good point, but there's none available, I'm sorry. Brad'll have to do.<br><br>Starting in a prison cell, you help Brad free himself and find his way on the ocean floor, through a medieval city, a junk yard and an ice castle. You command Brad via an icon bar that pops up if you press the right mouse button. Our hero can perform plenty of actions, e.g. wearing, inserting, combining or fighting. Apart from steering Brad around, you do not need to click on the screen. Brad has to stand next to the object he wants fiddle with, which will then appear as an icon in the command bar.<br><br>Curse of Enchantia features an interesting design element: The game manages to do almost without written messages. There are no object descriptions - the purpose of (most) items is apparent. In the rare occasions of interaction with <br>other characters, symbols in balloons substitute words. If there is text on the screen, it's either signs or comic phrases - splash! <br> <br><br>You cannot die in Curse of Enchantia; in fact, doing potentially deadly things is often rewarded with funny animations.

These bonds have dangerous magical powers that can take control of the heroes at the most inopportune times. They must now search for the source of the bonds, and free themselves from the curse.<br><br>The second in the  Gold Box series of role-playing games, Curse of the Azure Bonds is a sequel to  Pool of Radiance. The gameplay is nearly identical to that of the predecessor and other Gold Box games. Following the  AD&D rules of role-playing, the player creates a party of characters (up to the maximum of six). Two new character classes (Paladin and Ranger) are added to the four basic AD&amp;D classes Fighter, Thief, Mage, and Cleric, which were available in Pool of Radiance. Exploration takes place in pseudo-3D environments, from first-person view. Battles (random as well as pre-set) take the player-controlled and enemy party to a top-down battle screen. Commands are issued in turn-based fashion, and the player-controlled characters can freely navigate the battle field. There is also an overview "world map" that allows instant traveling between cities.

They have no long-range weapons, but if they touch him, he will find himself ex-ter-min-ated!<br><br>Fortunately for him, contact with them is as lethal to each other as it is to him.  Every time he takes a step, they all draw one square closer to him; The Doctor's cunning strategy is to manoeuvre himself so as to cause their paths to intersect and the Daleks to terminally collide, leaving a pile of rubble dangerous both to him and to subsequent Daleks -- a strategy not always possible on the narrow confines of a grid.  Fortunately for the good Doctor, where this game outdoes its predecessors is that he also has his trusty Sonic Screwdriver in hand, whose offensive use destroys all Daleks within a threatening one-square radius of him.  Also, it allows him to teleport out of harm's way to a random location on the map -- hopefully one behind a pile of Dalek rubble, and not one within a single step of a Dalek currently on the map.  In many versions both Sonic Screwdriver and Teleport use are limited.  Should The Doctor survive this onslaught, he is brought to a new grid map, generally one populated with still further Daleks.<br><br>Other features particular to some versions and absent from others include the use of graphical tiles vs. mere roguelike textmode character representation, and occasionally a conversion will use (universally unlicensed) sound effects taken from canonical Doctor Who sources; more commonly these games also offer a Last Stand command, to be used, like the "drop" in Tetris, when the player is so confident in the security of their location that they are willing to sit tight and grant the Daleks as many moves as it takes to either reach The Doctor or be rendered down into scrap metal through unforeseen collision.  Successful use of the Last Stand often results in a score bonus; unsuccessful use of it, of course, results in The Doctor's death.  (Don't worry, chances are good that he'll regenerate into a new incarnation -- not in this game, however.)<br><br>Some versions feature keyboard directional control (in which sometimes the player is granted access to diagonal movement like the Daleks are, and sometimes not), while others present The Doctor with a halo of directional arrows around him, to move him one step in the appropriate direction if an arrow is clicked upon.  Generally he also has the option of standing in place and passing a turn.

You are the brave adventurer taking on this quest through 14 increasingly-tough zones.<br><br>The bulk of the game is side-viewed, involving single screens to pass through, which incorporate ropes, cages and trapdoor. There are enemies walking, flying and hovering through this, and many of them respawn. Unusually your weapon to take them on (rocks) can be thrown through 360 degrees, which aims to make the gameplay more realistic and methodical. The screens were linked by hub screens, which the player passes through simply by clicking on a door.

At the start of each screen, an enemy wave comes flying from one or several directions until they form a tight formation at the top. One after one, they swoop down towards you and fire. If they reach the bottom of the screen, they wrap around to the top and revert to their original position. There are lots of enemy types with various kinds of armours and missiles. The gameplay is spiced up by giant enemies joining the formations and a flying saucer that flies across the top of the screen, firing target seeking missiles.<br><br>As you shoot down enemies, some will release power-ups. Common power-ups give you better fire power and fire rate, others give you extra lives, extra points or money. One special item will teleport you to the "memory station", where you play a memory game for bonuses. Another item-triggered sub-game is the asteroid field. The player must pass a long scrolling stretch of space, filled with space rocks of various sizes. Certain rocks give you money or points. Press the fire button, and you accelerate through the field. This is more dangerous, but rewarding if you pass the entire field, since you will then get a bonus score.<br><br>Once you complete a set of screens, you warp to the next level and enter the shop. Most of the game's upgrades are available here, at a price. Sometimes, the warp will malfunction, and you will be dropped off in limbo, where particularly powerful foes will strike at you. Defeat them, and you may resume your warp travel.

Renowned software undertaker Grandslam was happily ready to dig the grave several inches deeper for both. The spade: a game called Die Hard 2: Die Harder.<br><br>Based on the 1990 movie Die Hard 2, the program sends you through five stages modelled after key scenes of the film. As N.Y. cop John McClane, you have to shoot terrorists invading Washington’s Dulles airport by quickly aiming a crosshair at them. You’ll successively clear the luggage center, airport annexe and runway, then chase after the bad guys on a snowmobile and finally shoot it out on the wing of the terrorist’s plane. Each stage consists of three screens; on the last one, several tougher bosses will appear. Occasionally, civilians cross the room and pray that you don’t kill them. Most dying terrorists drop power-ups, namely med-kits, armour, grenades and weapons that are more powerful or fire faster. You collect these items by shooting them in time. If you do not aim fast enough, the terrorist’s bullets will drain your health; you may die three times, but after that, John McClane bites the dust once and for all. Until you restart, that is.<br><br>For more information on the movie Die Hard 2, see the trivia and links sections.

Flintheart Glomgold challenges Scrooge to a competition to see who the richest duck in the world is. They each have 30 days to see who can get the most money together and finally their dispute will be settled.<br><br>Scrooge’s office is your headquarters. Here you have three options – you can go exploring for treasure, play the stock market or dive into your money bin, occasionally finding a rare coin which adds to you treasure total. You need to get some money first before you can play the stock market though.<br><br>You main source of income comes from the exploration map which hangs on the wall. From here, you can pick a destination, which you can travel to. There are four different scenarios when travelling to various parts of the world. It’s these levels that are the most fun. You can choose to go mountain climbing, jungle bashing, search a cavern, or photograph some rare animals depending on your location. On screen information tells you which scenario it is, how long the trip will take and how much the treasure is worth. There’s also an island in the Indian Ocean you can visit to check on who’s winning between you and Glomgold.<br><br>You have to fly to each location and your transport is LaunchPad McQuack! You have to take off at the airport and fly to the destination. There are obstacles along the way though, watch out for powerlines (these are really funny, you run into them and boing! bounce back); hot air balloons dropping refrigerators, anvils, 10 ton weights and pianos; cumulo nimbus clouds shooting lightening and fluffly clouds; whales blowing water out their spouts; tall mountains, rocky outcrops, fireworks, hay barns among other things. Landing on the other side requires a special skill … Launchpads! You have to crash into the airport to land! Crash the plane though and it takes two days of your valuable time limit for Gyro Gearloose to fix it.<br><br>Using Huey, Dewey and Louie, each being one of your three lives in the mountain climbing level, you must get from the base of the mountain to the top to get your treasure. Using the boys, you can hop from ledge to ledge, or when the going gets tough, use your grappling hook! This is a lot of fun and requires precision. There are also caves in the side of the mountain, which can transport you up or down the mountain. But watch out for bears in the caves. Other obstacles include falling rocks, the Beagle Boys dropping objects from above, mountain goats, Magica de Spell and more.<br><br>The jungle features Scrooges’ nephews again. Here you must use swinging vines, branches and even hippopotamus’ backs to get to the treasure. Sleeping pumas, snakes, macaws and monkeys hamper you progress.<br><br>Searching a cavern involves Scrooge, his nephews and niece, navigating a maze using the map at the bottom of the screen to get to the treasure whilst avoiding the yeti tracking them down.<br><br>Photography, with Webbigail, Scrooge’s niece, involves her taking snaps of rare animals in a forest. Some animals get you more money for your snaps than others.<br><br>Once the thirty day marker is reached, whoever has the most gold between Scrooge and Glomgold is the winner.

Modern chess is only one variant offered—it has 10 versions of chess rolled onto one disk. Beginning in modern era, the program works its way back in time.  The authors mined gaming history books for versions of chess that most people have probably never heard of, both modern and ancient varieties. <br><br>The list of chess variants included are: Shatranj, Medieval Chess, Turkish Chess, Decimal Chess, Los Alamos Chess, Courier Chess, Chaturanga, Chinese Chess, Burmese Chess, and Byzantine Chess.<br><br>The oldest game on the disk is Chaturanga, a variant invented more than 1000 years ago in India.  More recent versions include Medieval and Turkish Chess, played in the middle ages.  Decimal Chess, which has a piece that combines a knight and a queen, is a modern variant of an older game.  The newest game of the group is Los Alamos Chess, which was designed to run on a MANIAC I computer with a 6x6 board.  Strangest looking of the games is Byzantine chess, which has a circular chess board.<br><br>This is not just a chess game; it is more of a survey of chess history.  The authors provide the histories of the games to place them into context with modern chess. They show how chess changed as it moved across cultures.  They cover the basics of chess—the rules, moves—and give players a glossary with chess terms.  Finally, they include a bibliography for those who want in-depth information.

Description=Dogfight is a two-player game with roots in the same primordial soup as Atari's Combat and other basic dogfighting games.<br><br>The two players take sides in an split-screen air battle above France in 1916. Player one starts off as an English pilot on the left side, and player two flies his red Luftwaffe plane from the strip on the right screen. At the end of each strip is a tree, so lift-off requires precision; too early and you will stall to the ground; too late, and you will crash into a tree.<br><br>As the two players fly towards each other, the split screen is joint as they reach visual contact, and likewise split off again if they fly away from each other. If a player is shot down, he must take off again from his base, and the winner gains a point. In the time it takes for the other player to lift off, you are at liberty to fly to his base and bomb both him and his hangar. Beware, though, for there is an AA emplacement at the base. The anti air artillery alternates between slow-moving shots and explosive flak, the latter being much more difficult to avoid. If you manage to bomb the artillery, the opposing player is more or less at your mercy – at least until the artillery is regenerated or if he manages to avoid your bombs and shots to shoot you down.<br><br>To spice things up, both sides have zeppelins which enter the game from time to time. The zeppelins are big targets but fire at you with great accuracy. In the middle of the playfield is a lake, where German and English U-boats take turns. They can be bombed, but have the same firepower as the AA batteries.<br><br>Control of your plane is imperative. Climbing too fast will put you into a stall, while steep dives will speed up your plane. Flying too high will also result in a stall, though this option can be turned off. If you manage to fly straight at the very top of the screen, you can take a shortcut above the mountain at the back of each air field. This will wrap you around to the opposing end of the screen.<br><br>Written in AMOS, Dogfight will let the players go on as long as they want, so the winner is usually he who first reaches a score set according to a gentleman's agreement.

Description=Doman: Grzechy Ardana (Doman: Ardan's Sins) is a brutal beat 'em up which tells the story of Doman, a Slavic response to the famous Conan, featured in a series of Polish comic books. Playing as Doman (or his buddy Baurus) you must end the tyranny of Ardan, fighting against his footmen, archers, mages and giant guards. You'll travel through forests, villages, shores and mountains, meeting NPCs, to finally reach Satan's Claw (Ardan's castle).<br><br>The game is a side-scrolling fighting game similar to the likes of Double Dragon: our protagonist heads relentlessly to the right, occasionally stopping to fight a group of more or less competent warriors who come at him. The gameplay and graphics style is similar to that of Franko, but this time a multiplayer option is offered. This game has more moves and combos (e.g.: decapitation) that can be performed and features more weapons to choose from (sword, axe, mace etc.). The package also contains a storybook.

Description=A variant on Shanghai, the ancient Chinese tile game, released when the official Amiga version was long unavailable.<br><br>A number of different types of tile are used, with 4 of each. These are arranged in a particular way, with some on top of others and some next to them. The idea is to remove pairs of tiles progressively so as to leave none remaining. However, a tile can only be moved if it has nothing on top of it, and has free space to either the left or right of it.<br><br>This version has 18 different tile layouts, and the tiles have modern pictures on them, ranging from Ghostbusters and Batman logos to computer chips and patterns of atoms, which makes the tiles more disttinct and colourful, and takes the game out of its old-fashioned context.

Worst of all your magic users won't help you out, either, because magic has been banned (to correct this unpleasing situation is one of your main objectives). <br>Other main targets are surviving, getting out of Purgatory and toppling Namtar (maybe getting some decent clothing, one or two shiny swords and the like on your way out).<br><br>Gameplay instantly reminds of the Bard's Tale series. Step-by-step first person 3D, opponents materialize out of the air. The combat system is turn based.<br><br>Unlike its (spiritual?) predecessors the game features a full-blown skill system, auto-mapping and many places to actually use all these abilities.<br>Reasonable distribution of your skill points is rather critical.

His nights are sequences of nightmares and strange dreams, days with frequent black-outs with strange visions, until one night a figure in monk attire appears to him, and tells him the story of the seven evil ones, uniting to destroy to Dreamweb, the only barrier between the world and darkness. The monk makes a proposition: Ryan becomes the deliverer: the one who would keep the Dreamweb safe by killing those who try to destroy it.<br><br>Descending into paranoia and just wanting dreams to stop, Ryan accepts the mission, then wakes up in a puddle of cold sweat, next to his beloved girlfriend in her house, and late for work. Again.<br><br>DreamWeb is a top-down adventure game set in a gritty futuristic/dystopian city. Each location takes only a small portion of the screen without panning (except an optional small zoom window in the corner that follows the cursor), with the player interacting with objects and people by simply clicking them. Ryan has a limited inventory space, and as a lot of objects can be picked up (many without any use), the player must rationalize what might be useful and just filler. Dialogue is straight forward, with no options, but still required to advance in the game (to find new locations, for instance). In situations where many adventure games often feature an indirect approach to solve a  problem, Ryan often faces himself with situations where it's "killed or be killed", which result in deaths  (sometimes of innocents).<br><br>The story isn't much developed inside the game, but the original release of the game included Diary Of a (Mad?) Man, a 40-page diary telling the descent of Ryan into madness, or his destiny, written by Stephen Marley provides a complete background to the events leading to the start of the game.

The Emperor Shaddam Corrino IV has given the Atreides House the rights to manage the extraction of the most precious substance in the entire universe - the Melange, commonly known as Spice in the desolate desert planet Arrakis (Dune), the only place in the universe capable of producing the substance. While everything indicates the offer is a trap orchestrated by their enemies the Harkonnen, the Atreides family agrees on moving, as he who controls the spice, controls the universe.<br><br>The player arrives in Arrakis with the mission of contacting and convincing the Fremen tribes residing in sietches (desert settlements) near the Atreides palace to harvest the spice. Harvesting is the most important part of the game, required to purchase equipment from the smugglers and appease the emperor. To speed up the process of harvesting, the player can equip the tribes with harvesters to increase production and ornis to protect them from the gigantic protectors of the planet: Shai-Hulud - the sandworms. <br><br>However, the spice doesn't last forever and new sietches must be prospected before having a mining crew assigned, but the player cannot run Southwards forever, as the Harkonnen enemy controls the North of the Planet, dangerously close to the Atreides Palace. Soon after the initial batches are sent to the Emperor, the player will have to actively deal with the Harkonnen, who will try to take control of player Sietches. For those, Fremen tribes can be assigned to military training with Gurney Halleck, but before doing such work Paul must have a certain reputation, gained by the control of Arrakis.<br><br>As the game advances, the player will untap Paul's latent powers, as well as meeting other characters from the Dune universe, such as Duke Leto, Jessica, Thufir Hawat, Duncan Idaho, Harah, Chani, Stilgar and Liet Kynes, the mastermind behind the ecological plans on Dune - the ultimate goal.

Description=The planet Arrakis (also known as Dune for its sandy landscape) is the only place in the known universe where Melange (more commonly known as the Spice) can be found. The Spice is the basis of interstellar travel and thus the standard of the Imperial economy. To increase productivity, The Padishah Emperor has invited three powerful Houses (Harkonnen, Atreides and Ordos) to compete against one another economically and bring up spice production. Competition among these houses begins peacefully but soon turns ugly as they battle each other with armed troops, advanced weaponry, and spies. The planet itself is also hostile, with dangerous sandworms inhabiting the spice fields.<br><br>Dune II is often considered the first mainstream modern real-time strategy game and established many conventions of the genre. Even though set in Frank Herbert's famous Dune universe, the game is only loosely connected to  the plot of any of the books or the films based from them. Controlling either of the three Houses, the player must fight a number of battles against the other Houses.  In the early levels, the goal is simply to earn a certain number of credits, while in the later missions, all enemies must be destroyed.<br><br>The single resource in the game is the Spice, which must be collected by harvesters. The spice is converted to credits in a refinery, which are then spent to construct additional buildings and units. There are two terrain types: buildings can only be constructed on stone, while the Spice is only found on sand. However, units moving on sand attract the large sandworms of Dune, who are virtually indestructible and can swallow even large units whole. As levels progress, new and more advanced buildings and units are made available, including structures like a radar station, a repair facility or defense turrets and, for units, various ground troops, light vehicles and tanks. Each House can construct one unique special unit, and, after building a palace improvement, can unleash a unique palace effect.<br><br>After a mission is completed, the player can select the next mission on a map of Dune. This choice determines the layout of the next map to be played, but has no effect on the overall campaign.

If this sounds familiar, it's no coincidence -- Zork/Dungeon is the primordial clay from which the first three games of the Zork series were fashioned, following some extensive refitting of set pieces -- due to the game's enormous size of one megabyte, making it commercially available for home microcomputers, with their limited memory and storage capabilities, was not considered a viable plan in 1979... until they came up with the idea of segmenting the giant dungeon up.<br><br>(Ports of this game also exist for VMS, the Acorn Archimedes, and the Z-code, TADS and GLK software platforms.)

Description=Eco is an action strategy game of sorts, which sets you in charge initially of a small single-celled organism, and challenges you to guide its evolution. Your initial tasks are to roam around finding food, and then find a potential mate. Depending on your organism's status, different predators will be after you - a radar is displayed to indicate where these are at any given time. Once this is done, you are taken to a screen displaying the species' genes, and you have the chance to modify one of them, thus resulting in evolution. Eventually you can evolve far enough to become plant, insect, fish or even human.

Description=ELIZA was the first chatterbot to make a splash in popular culture, originally written and conceived by Dr. Joseph Weizenbaum of MIT in 1966 to mockingly ape the style of a person-centered ("Rogerian") psychotherapist or counselor, largely by prompting the user to elaborate on topics sampled from previous user input.  A typical session would take the form of a typed dialogue (sometimes with simulated typing errors to further the suspension of disbelief), with the computer asking the user a series of questions and being fed responses from which to generate further questions.<br><br>ELIZA stimulated early consideration of computer artificial intelligence (or the appearance thereof), not infrequently passing the Turing test and fooling users into believing (for a little while, at least) that they were interacting with a real human being on the other end... blazing a trail subsequently followed down by Perry the Paranoid and Racter.  Additionally, the nods its conversational interface made toward natural language processing (or, again, the appearance thereof) are considered to have been influential on the early mainframe development of the interface for text adventure games such as Adventure and Zork.<br><br>Considered as a game, ELIZA is nearly the polar opposite to Emily Short's Galatea -- instead of the player probing the computer with questions, the computer probes the player with them.  Many different stories will still be revealed, but in this case, that's because it'll be people tricked by the program into telling them.

To save Elvira, you arrive at the studios of Black Widow Productions, where she is being held. Unfortunately, the whole studio is filled with monsters, as the horror movie sets have turned real. <br><br>Elvira II: The Jaws of Cerberus is an adventure/RPG first-person game. You begin by choosing one of the four classes for your character (which determines your starting attributes, such as Strength, Intelligence etc.). <br><br>For movement, you click the arrows in the bottom-right corner of the screen. Collecting items can be done via clicking on them in the first-person view window and dragging them into your inventory. (You can also click the "room" icon to see all the items that you've found in the room so far.) Should you encounter monsters, you fight by clicking on them. You can choose one of the four tactics (Normal, Defense, Fierce, Berserk) when fighting, and there's a number of different weapons you can find in the game. If you meet someone who doesn't want to murder you (a very rare occurrence) you can talk to him, though conversations are pretty simple and consist mainly of short phrases. <br><br>As you defeat monsters, explore the game world and cast spells (see below), you get experience. Once you have enough experience, you gain a level, and your attributes improve. <br><br>Thanks to Elvira's spellbook she gave you, you have the ability to create and cast spells. Some spells can be used to heal yourself, protect you in combat or damage your enemies, other are necessary to solve certain puzzles and make progress in the game. Creating a spell requires you to be of high enough level and to have the proper ingredients, different for every spell. The ingredients are usually gone forever once the spell is ready, so beware and don't use up any items vital for completing the game! Casting a spell requires you to use some amount of Power Points (PP), which regenerate automatically but slowly. What's more, you only get a limited number of castings when you prepare a spell, so don't waste them.

Description=Rather than copying Sensible Soccer or Kick Off, this football game features a number of comical and unrealistic touches. Although the view is top-down, the pitch is small and square, and the players appear huge on it. A range of moves including overhead kicks, trapping the ball and quick 1-2 passes can be mastered.<br><br>Before each match your team can choose special moves to assign to each player - power shots with ludicrous curve, super dribbling (making the ball stick to your foot), and a Barge power to push players out of the way. A full world cup tournament is offered, which up to 8 human players can partake in, as well as single exhibition matches. The action replays feature a VCR-style control.

Description=The object of the game is simple - gain control of the entire world by using your armies to crush your opponents. You'll start off with a city, which must then produce armies, that are used to conquer more cities. The array of unit types is limited to eight, including various ships, fighter planes, ground units and a submarine. This is more than made up for by the significantly different abilities each of the units possess, and the game will mostly likely appeal to the Chess and Risk player's of the world.

The squad composition is based on the 1991 status quo, which means you'll go into the Euro tournament with World Cup veterans such as Waddle, Beardsley and Wright, but without 1992 players like Alan Shearer or Alan Smith, infamous substitute to Gary Lineker in the Sweden match.<br><br>While Grand Slam got the England team and manager to officially endorse the game (thus having names and photos of 20 squad members from Robson to Gascoigne), they didn't buy the Euro Championship license. You'll be playing seven out of 22 European nations for the "Champions of Europe" title in a nondescript international tournament, from group matches to finals.<br><br>Mimicking Kick Off in style and perspective, European Championship Special is geared towards high-speed play at bottom-level complexity, with only one action key for kicks and slides and heads. No cards and hardly any penalties, primitive AI and straightforward gameplay make for goals galore, and the weather system turns out to be wind velocities only, which turns out don't affect the ball at all.

Most of the baddies can be avoided rather than shot, and this is often easier, especially as you can duck or jump to avoid them. As well as a standard gun (activated by tapping fire) you also have a limited number of missiles to take out installations (activated by holding down fire, which makes autofire facilities useless). The scrolling is flick-screen, perhaps as the game was designed for the C64, and the Amiga version was identical to the ST's.

Description=Explora 3 is a french point-and-click adventure game, the final sequel of the original Explora (released as Chrono Quest in English-speaking markets). The time traveling antics of the other games continue on this title, albeit in a more tangential way. You play as a writer with a severe lack of ideas that has a 3 month deadline to deliver a manuscript to his publisher. While watching TV you see your name linked to a report about a mysterious murder. It is your job to unravel this conspiracy.<br><br>The interface of the game has a more minimalist approach this time, the icons were reduced to only three revolving on the bottom-right of the screen: a magnifying glass to examine the scenario, a hand to pick and drop things, and a hammer as the "use" verb. Above these icons there is a clock: the developers added a dimension of time to the proceedings, and certain actions can only be performed at an exact time point. This installment also ditches the synthesized speech of the second game. <br><br>The games of this series share a common trait of being quite unforgiving: the player can easily get stuck on a unwinnable situation by forgetting to take some crucial object or not performing the exact action at the exact time. Death also comes swiftly and unexpected, sometimes only by opening a door at the wrong moment.

Description=The screen display in Extase depicts a symmetrical network of wires, some buttons, some fuses, some switches, and a picture of a female android in the middle. The overall aim is to restore sensory functions to the android, one in each level. All of this is done against an opponent, either human or computer, who controls the opposite half of the board.<br><br>This is done by guiding electrical pulses through each of the wires, however this can only be done once the wires have been woken up. You are in control of a cursor, which can click on the activation buttons to release a ball, which you direct using the cursor to reactivate wires on its path. Switches must be set to make all parts of this available – this can only be done when no ball is active.<br><br>Electrical sparks move around to make life harder, by destroying balls and fuses. Fortunately these can be 'zapped' using the cursor. New fuses can be generated by guiding a power beam into the fusebox, which is located centrally – simply pick up and place a generated fuse.<br><br>Better still, you can steal your opponent's, which is one of many ways the game becomes directly competitive. The two cursors cannot occupy the same space on screen, so hitting your opponent's cursor will jolt it. You can also adjust switches on both sides of the board, and summon sparks for your opponent to deal with. As the android is reactivated during the level it shows a range of facial expressions as a visual reward and measure of your progress.

Of course, it wasn't long before someone thought of a great way to make money out of our new neighbours and the first Hunters were dispatched from earth.

The Interstellar Conservation Executive has sent you, its newest recruit, off to Jupiter to study and document all the lifeforms you can find. You make money not by killing them, but by filming their actions. You can then use this money to upgrade your ship's engines and descend lower into Jupiter's atmosphere, to discover even weirder creatures. You'll also find people who want you to collect rare objects for them (also in exchange for cash), you'll find strange alien artefacts that may or may not help you in your quest and you'll probably have to engage in a few fights with the Hunters. It's a little sick, but these images will be broadcast to the audiences back home, too, so you'll make more money from that.

Beginning in the London underground, each level will present you with two tasks to complete: find a plane ticket to reach the next level, and destroy the ring leader of the area. To do this you will need to fight the (often well armed) thugs found in the various underground train stations and on the trains themselves. Each level consists of several stations; when all the thugs in a station are defeated, you may get on the train to go to a different station. The plane ticket you are searching for may be found in any one of these stations, and the level boss will be found in the last station. You are free to complete these two tasks in any order you choose, and don't need to visit the stations in any particular order. Fallen angel has the ability to perform a variety of kicks and punches to deal with the bad guys, and can occasionally pick up weapons.

There are plenty of tests of arcade skill along the way as well, as gaps must be jumped and baddies avoided - starting with a limited number of lives, the player can earn more by completing Theodore's puzzle.

Description=The background story of Fire & Ice is quick to tell: A coyote (you) runs, throwing ice cubes, through various worlds. In the levels you must jump on platforms and kill your enemies. The enemies (for example, birds and penguins) can be shot with your ice cubes; they become frozen, so you smash them. Sometimes they leave part of a key behind after they're destroyed.  The complete key, assembled from all the pieces, opens the door to the next world. <br><br>In this &quot;jump & run&quot; you can also get some power-ups. You can find some coyote puppies; these puppies follow you, are invulnerable, and also shoot enemies. In higher regions you find some snow-flakes; enough of these and you get a great snowball for freezing more enemies on the screen.

You fly your spaceship above a landscape rendered in primitive graphics, a landscape guarded by small gun emplacements. Your goal is to fly your spaceship through – and into – the terrain, in order to pick up a ball with your towing line, and fly it out of the underground mazes and up in the sky. The problem is that you have gravity to contend with, as well as the inertia of yourself and the ball; flying carelessly with the ball in tow will set you and the ball into a pendulum-like course and you may end up in a wall. You have a cannon to shoot the gun pods with.

Whether or not they actually got the approval—remember this was 1984, and such application of personal computers was new ground—they attempted to create a realistic flight simulator.<br><br>This flight simulator simulates a real aircraft, the Piper PA-23-181 Archer II.  For those with the knowledge, it offers practice with the variables of flight, including the avionics. The Atari ST-release (1986), instead, simulates the Cessna 182 single engine propeller aircraft and the Gates Learjet 25G twin engine jet. <br><br>The simulator was considered to be a second generation product.  It had many more features than first generation flight simulators, and pilots were expected to pay attention to small details.  SubLOGIC encouraged the users of the game to go to flight stores and purchase flight-training manuals and aeronautical charts to help them understand the variables within the program.  The game was oriented toward pilots-in-training, but there were options for non pilots too: the company included an easy mode, and a slightly more detailed reality mode.  These modes did not require the same level of knowledge.<br><br>Flight Simulator II was also packaged with a WWI dogfighting game, called WWI Ace.  In this game your plane is armed with bombs, machine guns, and a radar screen.  The radar screen is anachronistic for a game set in World War I, but it is there to help gameplay.

Description=Somewhere in London is a secret organization that is based on 13th floor of an office building. The sole purpose for this organization’s existence is to keep the current British government in power at any cost - specifically, that means keeping the current Prime Minister keeps ahead of his competition in the polls.<br><br>Floor 13 is a management simulation controlled by a menu-based system (similar to Darklands) and is presented in black and white for a film noir feel. Players take the role of the Director General in this secret organization, and are given a target date of 20 days to attend to their duties. During this period, performance will be evaluated based on the Prime Minister's polling results. If the PM is doing well, the agency will be expanded and will have more equipment and services available to handle the situations it will encounter later in the game. If the PM is behind, Floor 13 risks reduction in the number of services it has available or the even player's continued employment. After each successful 20 day period, another 20 days are added to the calendar, full of new problems and objectives.<br><br>During the time between target dates, players will have to deal with various problems, both externally and internally. Some examples include: saving the son of the U.S. President from terrorists, breaking up a drug ring controlled by a VIP recently honored by the Queen, or even prevent a scientist in the British space agency from publicly stating that their latest achievement has been a total sham (shades of the film "Capricorn One"). While you are completing these tasks there is another secret society that will pressure you to have its goals completed, and this may very well interfere with the missions officially assigned to Floor 13.<br><br>The Floor 13 organization is not a benevolent one and players will need to do some rather unpleasant things to ensure that the democratic machine runs smoothly. Examples of activities include: searching and looting people’s homes, calling in commando units for heavy assault purposes, wire-tapping and trailing people without bothering to go through legal channels, discrediting notable people through the media and infiltrating established organizations. At times, you might even need to detain citizens and torture them (the torture bits can get rather graphic at times, though it's doled out through a text report), or even assassinate troublesome proles (one of the few political policy games, along with Shadow President and CyberJudas, to allow for such an activity). However if players become too eager at performing these "black hat" activities, they may draw too much attention to the agency and may summon the attention of a certain "Mr. Garcia" (who is good at helping noisy Director Generals fly through office windows).

The ship can take some damage, and repairs itself over time (for no logical reason), which is one of the few things that gives you a hope of getting anywhere early on.

Most games have multiple difficulty levels, which reveal themselves after the easiest has been solved.<br><br>If Teddy's friend is to climb the tree successfully, you must recognise which of the items in front of you can be paired up. Initially there are 6, rising to 18 as you get them right. The Gallery game involves matching pictures with the correct label, with more and more options as the game difficulty increases. In the actions game you must choose an action word and watch Teddy act it out.<br><br>To help teddy get up the steps to his beloved honey, you must correctly count the numbers of everyday objects such as teddies, trees and clouds on a screen. The Letters game takes place at the fair - matching the letters displayed will earn your Teddy an ice cream. Parents may wish to offer the same reward to their children, but should watch out for E numbers. The colouring module is less a game and more an experiment in design - choose the colours of each item to form a picture.

The difference is that physical contact of a fairly violent nature is allowed, and the court is littered with mines and bombs to wound the players. Shooting involves holding down fire to get the height right, so avoid being tackled as you prepare your shot. Other basketball rules such as double-dribbling and the 25-second hand-over are unsurprisingly waived. A 3-division league is included to progress through.

Avoid turrets, bombs, and other obstacles.<br><br>Lost 'N Maze:  Quickly travel through the corridors of the maze until you locate the keys to the exit.  Collect various power-ups and bonus points along the way.<br><br>Diet Riot:  Put all the junk food stores out of business by having your man gather all the food crates for each store and throw them in the dumpster.  Beware of junk food -- eating it slows you down and threatens you with a heart attack; you can "work out" using the exercise equipment to speed back up, as well as eating healthy food.<br><br>Blockalanche:  An isometric-view Tetris clone, with the differences of being able to select your next piece (if you're quick enough) and being only able to rotate your block around one axis.<br><br>The gameplay options are also quite varied:  Each game can be played one player alone, two players alternately, two players simultaneously, or one player against one of three computer personalities -- including split-screen play for head-to-head competition.

You must knock globes into others of the same colour, to rid the screen of all the globes. The screen has no borders, so globes can be pushed off the side of the screen, increasing your tactical range. Knocking globes of different colors into each other produces smaller pods which need to be picked up quickly, giving you energy, or they will turn into globes and you will have to get rid of them too. Many of the globes are linked to other globes (or the ship) via string, and the level layouts include barriers as obstacles (and ricochet points), making the Newtonian physics more complex.

This body consists of five different types of cells: The proto cells (the "flesh") will grow quickly and aimless, unless you border them with skin. To control proto growth, you can install control cells; they consume energy produced by support cells. Sense cells will provide you with information about the well-being of your organic entity. <br><br>The basic cells will grow all by themselves, but also rot if left unattended. Your task is control: Move or destroy unwanted cell blocks, build and link a power supply throughout the structure, prevent decay and (in later missions) virus attacks. There are 99 levels to fulfill. Early ones make you rebuild a given design; later on, you'll have to reach goals like a certain amount of energy stockpiled. The time for each mission is limited.

Description=Like in the prequels you empty areas infested by all kinds of enemies while running for the exit. Like this was rather a straight forward thing in the first two games, it's not that easy to finish a level anymore. While you only had to run until you find the exit (and besides killing hordes of enemies you probably find some keys to unlock doors leading to deeper dungeons) you might have to solve a few "quests" to proceed to the next level in this installment.<br>These "quests" are very basic, for example you have to find object A, then bring it to B, advance to C and finally go to D to uncover the exit.<br>The big difference is the graphics. While you had a top down view in the first 2 games Gauntlet 3 has an isometric kind of view.<br>The old 4 characters (warrior, wizard, elf and valkyrie) are ready for action again and this time they get backup by 4 new characters which include the Lizard, Neptune, Stoneman and the Iceman.

The game is viewed top down, and can be set to either move left-right or top-bottom.<br><br>League and cup tournaments are included, as are single matches and set-piece practice sections (you have full control of these). The gameplay involves a number of advanced moves, and includes a gauge to control the exact dimensions of a kick (height and curl as well as strength), if you can use it quickly enough. Unusually, you have control over the goalkeeper, so can only blame yourself when you concede a goal. The players each have their own skills and strengths, and these develop as the game goes on – if you play well, your players become better, and more capable of facing better opposition.

Description=One of not-nearly-enough games to star an amorphous blob, Globdule sees your character moving around a level by sliding along walls, or jumping off them onto a nearby surface. Each level has a set amount of fruit, all of which must be collected by crossing its path, before reaching the exit. This must all be done within a time limit, and many levels involve collecting keys to unlock doors which are located elsewhere. There are enemies after the first few levels, who must be killed by hitting them, then their eyes must be collected as they wander off. You can withstand 7 hits on each life, but losing a life resets the level.

Description=Every five years the various races inhabiting the fantasy world of GHoLD meet for the Grand Monster Slam tournament to discover which is supreme. You must win a total of 9 matches to prove yourself, with two sub-games to negotiate (Revenge of the Beloms and Faulton Feeding - fortunately these can be practiced from the main menu) as well.<br><br>The basic game sees you and your opponent start with a row of six Beloms (small round creatures) which must be kicked across the pitch quickly enough to leave your opponent with all 12 at his end. When this happens you can run to his end to win. The main things to avoid during the match are being hit by a shot and kicking one into the crowd. When hit you lose time recovering, and are penalised with a Pelvan, which can cost you up to 3 Beloms, by hitting the crowd.<br><br>After every third match you must play the Faulton Feeding game, which involves aiming at six progressively-higher poles to hit the Faulton creature with the food - fail to get enough of these and you must replay the previous match. After other games you play the Revenge of the Beloms game, in which Beloms hurtle towards you and must be deflected away with your pole - failure to clear enough before one hits you reduces your score from the previous match.

Description=Every aspect of the famous horse race, held over the daunting hurdles course at Aintree in Liverpool every April, is recreated here. Before each race you can place bets on up to five horses, with the odds calculated realistically, even taking betting tax into account. When choosing which horses to back, and which one to actually ride, you must consider the 'going' (what condition the ground surface is in) and which horses are likely to suit your style.<br><br>Once the race is underway you must direct the horse left and right (weaving across other horses can cause disqualification in the post-race Steward's Enquiry), jump at the right time to clear each hurdle, and crack the whip to speed up the horse. During the race you will be told how many horses are still running, as well as your own position and the identity of the leader.

Description=GF2, as it is known to its friends, is one of the most advanced cave-flyers available. Borrowing its name and looks from the original Gravity Force by Kingsoft, which was an advanced Thrust clone, it diverts from its namesake by being a two-player-only game.<br><br>GF2 stands out not only because of its clean graphics and sense of humour, but also because of its enormous range of preferences in order to customise the physics variables and capabilities of the players ship so as to make the game perfectly suited to each player. Furthermore, it has a stunning amount of levels on varying themes, more of which could be created with the level editor (available to registered users).<br><br>The different levels of GF2 are split up into themes such as Grass Worlds, Lego Worlds, Slime Worlds and Boring Worlds. Each player starts out on his home base with a fully loaded ship. The objective is simply to destroy the player by any means possible, be they to simply shoot him down, bomb him or to ram him into a wall, thereby depleting his shields. If your shields, fuel or ammunition is running low, you must return to your (or even you opponent's) base to refuel. However, landing makes you vulnerable to enemy bombardments.<br><br>Apart from the plain dogfighting levels, GF2 also offers a large amount of race levels, where the players race around a maze-like level where they must pass check points. Flying your ship around these levels is not as easy as it may seem, since you must fight gravity, just as in Thrust, but unlike Asteroids.<br><br>GF2 was part, if not the progenitor, of the cave-flying trend that hit the Amiga in the mid-nineties, alongside games such as Bratwurst or Turboraketti.

Description=Hacker is an adventure/trading game based on what was then a unique idea. You're starting into the adventure as a real hacker would do, lacking information of what is to come, only driven by your ambition. Consequently, the game opens with a plain text screen, prompting you for the login password. To break into the system is the first puzzle you've got to solve.<br><br>Once in, you'll soon find out that you've accidentally stumbled upon a conspiracy of global impact. From then on, you'll maneuver a robotic drone around the globe through a tunnel system deep in the earth. In major cities, you may surface and talk to contact persons, who'll trade items for cash. When delivered to the correct city, you can exchange these items for a piece of evidence. If all evidence is collected, you're to inform the FBI. As if figuring out the correct routes and trades wasn't hard enough, frequent system malfunctions and security checks test your skill as well...

Description=Hacker II: The Doomsday Papers is a real-time strategy game.<br>It is the sequel to Hacker <br><br>Once again you hack into a computer system, just to end up saving the world. Hacker II: The Doomsday Papers opens with the console to the "Actisource" computer hotline system (a nice self-ironic pun - although nobody knows why a serious hacker might want to crack a help service for computer games...). However, your quiet little hack is soon disturbed: The government wants you for a secret mission. It, again,  involves a robot drone and you're the one at the remote control. Although this time, it's not the whole globe that's your playground, but a high security facility in Russia, where the plans for global domination are hidden.<br><br>In fact, all you've got to do is to guide your drone to the vault on a 2D map of the building. However, there are two major obstacles: Patrolling guards and security cameras. To avoid detection, you've got to trick the observers. By tapping the surveillance system you can see what cameras are currently active and which rooms they monitor. Your task is to bypass the video signal of the right cameras with a taped recording of an empty room, so that your drone is hidden from the view. You control four monitors, which you may freely switch to show the security monitor, the radar map, VCR output or one of the 38 cameras -- thus keeping an eye on guard movement while simultaneously controlling your drone and synchronizing recordings to cameras. Whew, sounds like a lot of work? It is.

Description=The military is often painted in terms of precision.  Orders are expected to be followed exactly.  But what happens when those giving the orders are blind?  Blindness is a fact of life for commanders, who have to wait for their men to call in with information.  This game puts the player in the shoes of a Corps commander—a man responsible for several divisions—for the lives of thousands of men.  The player will command some of the most famous battles in U.S. history, and will have to deal with the same lack of face-to-face contact that plagues every higher-level military leader.<br><br>In this game the player replays historical battles in the wars with Mexico, World War I, World War II and the Korean War.<br><br>Think for a moment about war from the perspective of the Marine.  Out in the field, their duty is to carry out orders to the best of their ability.  They must try to cope with the unexpected that interferes with their progress—weather, enemies, terrain, fatigue, lack of supplies... Unfortunately, it is a fact that there is a disconnect between soldiers in the field and the commanders in the command centers. Commanders don't have a personal connection to each person under them.  They rely on those underneath them to report in...<br><br>This game gives some insight to the problems of command.  There are hundreds of units to keep track of, and the player needs a way to keep them organized.  The units become symbols on a map-board.  Contact with the units is limited to the reports that they send back and the orders that the player sends out.  Once the orders are given, the situation is really out of your control.  Will they be able or willing to follow orders exactly?  What happens if they are interrupted by the enemy, by weather, by terrain.  Is the information on enemy movements accurate, or did the player just send a division (thousands of men) to their deaths?<br><br>Most soldiers and Marines have never had the opportunity to see just what goes on inside the command centers, where the orders that they must follow come from.  This game recreates the command center.

Description=Hard Drivin' is a 3D arcade hit from Atari Games. You are in control of a high-performance sports car. Your objective is to race around the course as fast as possible and hit as many checkpoints as possible. If you hit a checkpoint you gain extra time to go farther. You will see traffic on the road both in your direction and coming down the opposite direction, so be careful when you pass... <br><br>The course has two sections: speed track, and stunt track. Speed track is longer, but you can usually achieve higher speeds. Stunt track requires you to perform several stunts such as jumping bridges, driving through a loop, and so on. <br><br>Crashing the car has no serious consequences and indeed shows a replay of your crash from a cinematic angle. Admire your crash head-on into the cement truck, or clipping the minivan, or flying off the bridge in the wrong angle... You lose several seconds as your car is "reset" and you get up to speed again. <br><br>The home conversions retain most of the then-advanced 3D graphics but lack the force-feedback that was in the arcade version.

Heimdall's job is to protect the entrance to Asgard, the home of the gods, from all evil, including the terrible Ragnarok, when all the evil forces come together to try and destroy the gods and ultimately everything. <br><br>Unfortunately Ragnarok is on its way and if that wasn't bad enough, Loki, god of mischief, has hidden Thor's hammer, Odin's sword and Frey's spear in three worlds. You, as the newly mortalized Heimdall, must visit each of these worlds to collect the god's weapons.<br><br>The first is Midgard (or Earth), the second is Utgard (the world of the giants) and the third is Asgard itself, the home of the gods. Each world has around 15 islands and each island has countless rooms.<br><br>When you start your mission you are given three sub-games to complete. How well you complete these games determines Heimdall's stats (strength, agility etc) as well as how many people he can choose from to make up his party. If you don't do well then you won't get the full 30 characters to choose from and some of the better ones will not be available to you.<br><br>The first sub-game is the Axe Throwing Contest. Here you must throw axes at a young barmaid tied to a stock by her pig-tails. The idea is to hit the pig-tails and not her! Unfortunately because Heimdall is a bit drunk, your cursor wobbles all over the place! The second sub-game is Pig Catching (where you must chase and hopefully catch a pig in its pen) and the third is the Long Boat Fight (where you must try and get to the other side of the long boat without being thrown overboard).<br><br>Once you've done this it's time to wander around the isometric landscape solving puzzles and killing baddies (in a similar style to Cadaver) until you eventually find one of the god's missing weapons.

Give chase or open fire if necessary. When the bad guy is arrested, a court trial may follow.<br><br>Hill Street Blues is controlled entirely with the mouse via a set of icons – that’s everything but intuitive, especially when directing a single officer through the streets. Since there will soon be multiple crimes all over the city, the challenge is to co-ordinate multiple officers simultaneously and keep track of cases and suspects. If your success rate is high enough, you will ultimately be promoted to chief of police.

You start with limited fuel, but more can be collected as you cover the track. Hitting hazards can cause your car to explode, thus costing time as it is replaced.<br><br>Unusually the racetracks are linear rather than lap-based, so each round involves covering a section of track once. After each race, you can purchase upgrades at the shop, depending on how much money you earned in the previous race.<br><br>Only part of the circuit is shown at a time, and this scrolls following the leader. If you fail to keep up with this, your car is moved forward on the track, with a penalty fuel deduction. This is slightly similar to the system later used in head-to-head games of Micro Machines, and is especially punishing while you are on roads travelling horizontally and the leading CPU car is travelling vertically, as it makes the margin for error much smaller.

Three knockdowns are needed for the player to move onto the next opponent.<br><br>Bonus points are awarded for the remaining energy Kwon has when he has successfully defeated his opponent. The player has five lives, and if all of them are used up, the game is over.

The ball usually bounces once before reaching the batsman, a player from the opposing team. In defence of the wicket, the batsman plays the ball with a wooden cricket bat. Meanwhile, the other members of the bowler's team stand in various positions around the field as fielders, players who retrieve the ball in an effort to stop the batsman scoring runs, and if possible to get him or her out. The batsman — if he or she does not get out — may run between the wickets, exchanging ends with a second batsman (the "non-striker"), who has been waiting near the bowler's wicket. Each completed exchange of ends scores one run. Runs are also scored if the batsman hits the ball to the boundary of the playing area. The match is won by the team that scores more runs.<br><br>Choosing between a bowler, or a batsman, game player defines the role of its team. During the match game player may control all his team players, nearest to the ball to achieve the main goal.

Beware: 8 levels of <br>isometric death await.<br><br>The Immortal is the prototype of a trial-and-error game. Progress is made by encountering a hazard, dying, solving the problem, encountering the next hazard. To solve a level, you have to know its traps and their patterns by heart. As frustrating as this may sound (it is), The Immortal quite cleverly balances annoyance with curiosity and graphical rewards. In short: You want to see what challenge lies in the next room.<br><br>The puzzles range from simple avoidance of traps to the correct use of items; you collect objects in an inventory. Every now and then, The Immortal surprises with a special challenge. For example, you've got to ride a magic carpet through a hallway full of fire traps, or ride a barrel on an underground river. The dungeon isn't empty: some friedlies may have valuable information or trade items, the nasty sort of guys will attack. Combat is fought man-to-man on a special screen. Your adversary indicates his next attack a few seconds before he executes it, so you've got time to react appropriately. You can dodge to the left or the right, as well as attack from these two directions. There is no save option in the game, of course, but you may restart each level as often as you like. Levels can be skipped by entering passwords.

Description=The famous Indianapolis 500 Mile race, held annually at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway on the Memorial Day weekend, is one of the most famous automobile racing events in North America. The event is simulated here using 3D polygon graphics to recreate the  33 cars in the race.  Players are able to choose their car and customize it with a variety of options. Modifications include wing down-force, tire pressures, wheel stagger (making the right-side wheels larger, to compensate for the banked corners) and turbo output (which provides boost, but stresses the engine and uses more fuel).<br><br>After qualifying (by performing during four laps and taking the average) players can race over 10, 30, 60 or the full 200 laps. Lower modes remove car damage and the 'full-course yellow' system, the absence of these can make for repeat carnage including traffic collisions and huge pile-ups.

Description=This tennis simulation followed up Simulmundo's 3D World Boxing, while 3D World Soccer was the final game in the series. There is some sports management involved as the player you choose (from pre-built selection or from your own creation) can improve his skills (forehand, backhand, serve, volley, etc.) as he wins matches and prize money and moves up in the rankings.  <br><br>There's 4 different play options: Singles Match, Singles Tournament, Grand Slam, and ATP Tour.  You must be qualified to play for the last two options based on your current ranking.  Beating opponents ranked higher will move your own ranking higher more quickly.<br><br>The playing view is directly from behind the player but as you approach the net it is scaled to always be appropriate for what the player would see from that vantage point. The players are viewed in large well-animated forms and even the backgrounds of crowd scenes are also animated.  At the bottom of the screen there are player's photos and ability bar graphs as well as a small overhead view of the player's positions on the court.

You know, the kind of totalitarian gang which is led by a mad, thoroughly evil genius from his giant underground base. Don't worry, the CIA is already searching for the plane. Yes, I'm certain. If you would please excuse me now, my plane is about to depart. Oh, just to a beautiful, jungle-island banana republic. Holiday?

Description=In his second adventure James Pond must retrieve the toys Dr Maybe has stolen. Pond has been armed with an Inspector Gadget-style stretch device, which he can use to view higher areas or claw onto ceilings so as to slide across them.<br><br>The gameplay takes place across worlds themed around particular types of toys, such as sporting goods, candy and aircraft. The levels scroll sideways, although a small amount of vertical movement is included. On each level Pond must collect 2 penguins and reach the exit, although there are usually multiple exits and lots of secret areas to explore. After completing each pair of two worlds (each of which has three sub levels), a boss must be faced.

Description=Unlike the  first game of the series, that was a mission-based game, and the  second one, where your character had unique abilities such as observing the whole level and growing to unlimited height, "James Pond 3" is a standard jump and run platform game. Pond can run very quickly (by holding down the A button) through large levels, which often contain steep mountain sides and other tricky areas. Once again, he has to oppose the evil scientist Maybe and his minions.

Description="James Pond" is (obviously) a parody on the famous agent 007 stories. You control Pond, a fish-like creature, who has to complete several missions, while making his way through levels full of dangers and hostile creatures. It is not a typical "jump and run" game: instead of breezing through large levels, Pond has to complete unique missions for each game area: free hostages, detonate a structure, find keys, etc. It is possible to exit a level only after having completed the objective. Many missions are timed.

Description=The last commercial flight simulator to be released for the Amiga for at least ten years, JetPilot offered simulation of two NATO combat air planes that were already well on their way of being replaced in most air forces around the world (A bit like the Amiga at that point in time, the cynical reader might think), namely the English Electric Lightning and the Lockheed F-104 Starfighter. Additionally, the aging MiG-21 is on offer for that retro Warzaw Pact taste.<br><br>Branding itself as "The pinnacle of realistic flight simulation", JetPilot makes no attempts to conceal the intricacies of real-life piloting. The aircraft are available in a wide range of different specifications, along with real-life airfields from around northern Europe. The environment may be fine-tuned to your preferences, not only for time of year and day, but also for temperature, winds and air pressure. Communications between aircraft and with the tower is also handled with accuracy, and with a bit of Vulcan Software's trademark speech technology.<br><br>Striving for realism, JetPilot does what no other Amiga simulator had done before by ignoring digital joysticks. Mouse or analogue joystick are your only main control options, with the mouse also being used for moving your head around the cockpit and accessing its functions. The keyboard is also put to ample use.<br><br>Despite being a late release, JetPilot still clings to the proven filled polygons for graphics rendition, but offers support for higher resolutions and flicker-free graphics on applicable machines.

The plan is that you will "borrow" aircraft from local air forces and carry out secret strike missions on SPUDD forces while they are still small enough to have to stay hidden. Hopefully, by damaging their supply lines, factories and control centres, you should be able to ruin their plans of world domination. However, if you wreck too many expensive aircraft, your sponsors will not be able to cover for you, resulting in your sent back to the secret agent's Basic Training School.<br><br>In Jetstrike you must stop the devious SPUDD forces by attacking them with your "borrowed" aircraft.

As Kronstadt drifts into chaos in the course of eleven days in November, a teenager bound to the wheelchair dabbles in Celtic mysticism and discovers his talent for magic. Bourgeois bliss, late-80’s youth culture, occultism and photorealistic nudity mix into a psychedelic nightmare that stands out as the most perplexing German adventure game.<br><br>The successor to Holiday Maker and Stadt der Löwen, and Phoenics’ (formerly PM Entertainment) third (and last) adventure game, Jonathan was a child of the dusk of Germany’s vibrant Amiga scene, where a maximum of finesse met a new minimum of public interest. <br><br>Jonathan is unconventional to the brink of schizophrenia, both in style and gameplay. The actual adventure actions in a colorless, messy interface are contrasted with the sumptuous high-res artworks of the frequent cutscenes. Many of these revolve around the members of the protagonist Jonathan’s clique, who are essential to the game – the disabled young man must rely on their help to do things he is unable to do. <br><br>As the game switches perspective and explores the minds of Jonathan’s friends, it focuses on their sexuality with a unabashed bluntness that should have shocked the pampered German audience, had anyone bought it.

Description=A remake of the Commodore 64 games Trailblazer and Cosmic Causeway, Jump ‘N’ Roll involves guiding a rendered spherical object through a succession of landscapes. There are theoretically more than 9 levels; I say “theoretically” because the 9th one appears to be impossible. The landscapes are always 5 squares wide, and while many of these are just standard squares, there are several different types, differentiated by colour. There are black holes which cause the ball to drop, costing you valuable time, although you get a limited number of jumps on each level, which are accessed by pressing fire. Yellow squares speed the ball up, while red slows it down. Green causes the ball to stick and be immovable until it clears that section, purple reverses the left and right control, while blue gives a free jump (be careful not to miss the next jump pads while in the air though). Points are given depending on how far you progress in each level, and how quickly you complete it.

The R-Type influence on the weapons is most obvious with up to two protection satellites hovering above and below the ship, as well as the R-Ball, an indestructible object that can be docked to the front of the ship and be used as both a weapon and a shield (and thus is basically the same as R-Type's Force).<br><br>The game offers a two-player mode, with two players taking turns.

Matches can be varied between 10 and 90 minutes. The ball is loosely controlled in a manner similar to the Kick off series, although it isn’t possible to pass the ball a short distance, so an element of hitting and hoping comes into play, especially as the ball can’t be curved far. The ball bounces quite heavily, and is very difficult to shoot on target from closer than 30 yards or so.

Description=Kid Chaos is transported from the stone age into an unknown world by evil scientists from the future. Now he must fight his way through artificial environments such as the Secret Garden, Toxic Wasteland, Toy Factory, Techno Fortress, and the Ruined City to reach the time machine that can transport him back home.<br><br>Kid does this by running through the level, destroying all wildlife and several destruction targets, then leave the level by the exit door, which remain closed until Kid has destroyed all destruction targets. He destroys by swinging his club in the air and hitting them. He can also whiz if he's running fast, which enable him to discover hidden passages through walls that usually contain apples and power-ups. These are also found if Kid manages to jump really high in the air and lands on a platform that usually lead to secret passages.<br><br>There are five levels and four sections to complete in all of them (a total of twenty levels) and Kid start each level with three lives. During the level, if he loses health just by touching wildlife, or if the time expires, he is warped out of the level, loses a life, and has to restart the level at the checkpoints he passes through. His health can be restored either by waiting for the health meter to reach 99 (the boring way) or collecting apples (the smart way), but as Kid progresses further throughout the game, these apples become rare as well as his destruction targets. <br><br>Once he leaves a level, Kid is given a statistics screen, telling him the percentage of destruction he has caused, how much wildlife he has killed, how many apples he collected, and other extras. These "extras" probably include how much more of his destruction targets he broke beyond the requirement.<br><br>As mentioned earlier, if Kid jumps really high to reach a platform, he can get power-ups, giving him such wonderful things like extra lives, extra time, or extra health. He can also collect a life token. If he manages to find three life tokens within the same section, then he is awarded an extra life as well.<br><br>Every fourth level, Kid will be faced with a challenge, and the object of these is usually to kill something, but there's always a catch for these challenges. For example, in Toy Factory, he has to shoot teddy bears at least ten times to blow them up, while avoiding shooting at ducks; and in Techno Fortress, he's presented with a game similar to Space Invaders, but only this time, there are no barriers. <br><br>Kid Chaos starts off easily, but the further he progresses in the game, the higher the damage factor. Early in the game, he is allowed to hit so much wildlife before he loses a life, but as he progresses through each level, he can't afford to be hit not even once. Some levels in the game are quite tricky. Some levels require him to race through the level under a very strict time limit, while others contain a huge destruction target and he can't afford to miss any of these targets.<br><br>The game uses a password system, that allows you to resume at the start of each level. In terms of the gameplay, one of the cheats say it all.

The initial coin-throwing is pretty weedy, but better weapons (as well as extra lives and smart bombs) can be bought in the shop, which appears every 5 screens.<br><br>The levels are flick-screen, and can usually be finished in different ways, which results in different starting positions on the next screen, and you can travel back and forth through them, for example to pick up bonuses which are visible but not accessible as the level starts.

When he returns, he discovers with horror that his home, Daventry Castle, has completely disappeared!  Graham is at a loss, and wonders how this could have happened, when a talking owl named Cedric appears.  He tells him that he saw the whole thing, and that an evil wizard named Mordack whisked the entire castle away, along with Graham's family in it.  Cedric offers to take him to his homeland, Serenia, where his master, the wizard Crispin resides.  Surely Crispin will be able to help King Graham rescue his family from Mordack's clutches.<br><br>King's Quest V: Absence Makes the Heart Go Yonder is an adventure game, and the first from Sierra to use a point-and-click mouse interface.  Rather than typing commands on a keyboard to interact with the game world and use the arrow keys to walk around, King's Quest V instead simplifies all actions down to base commands.  To access the different cursors, the player can move the mouse to the top of the screen, revealing a hidden menu with each of the different actions, as well as game options and the inventory bag.  By clicking the "Walk" cursor on the screen, Graham will walk as close as he can to the appropriate area.  Clicking the "Eye" cursor on items will provide a description, the same as typing "Look at".  The "Hand" cursor is a multipurpose cursor that can be used to push, pull, interact with and pick up objects.  The "Head" cursor is used to talk to people (and in the strange world of King's Quest, often objects and animals, too).  Players can also right-click to cycle through the different available cursors.  Inventory that Graham picks up now gets placed into a bag.  By clicking on the bag, this opens up a sub-window that displays all the inventory that Graham currently has.  In here, players can look at or interact with objects, combine them with other objects, or pick them up to use them in the game environment as another cursor.<br><br>As with most Sierra games, it is quite possible to die.  Bumping into witches, poisonous scorpions, falling off edges of cliffs, dying of thirst in the desert, and many other objects, locations and characters will send Graham to an untimely demise.  The player must be cautious as they explore Serenia - frequent game saving across multiple files is usually the best course of action to make sure that you don't get stuck or have to start right from the game's very beginning.

His troubles are far from over, however, as he soon finds out that the King and Queen have passed away, the Greens Isles are on the brink of war, and his beloved Princess Cassima may even be held prisoner by the royal vizier.<br><br>For Alexander to save the Isles, he must travel between the Land's four magical islands, each based on myth and fables, and encounter people and strange beasts that will either help or hinder him. Alexander must be careful as well, because, as with all the King's Quest games, poor choices or missteps will often prove fatal for the Prince. Puzzles are solved linearly, although late in the game there are two completely different paths to take to reach the final confrontation. Like its predecessor, actions are performed using a point-and-click interface. The CD-ROM version of the game includes both DOS and Windows versions, full speech, a 50-meg introduction, and the Girl in the Tower theme song.

Description=A version of an old Norse board game called King's Table. The game has black and white teams, like chess, but each team has different pieces and a different raison d'etre. <br><br>The white team has a total of 13 pieces, the most important one being Odin the King, who starts in the centre of the 10x10 board and moves in the same way as a chess King, whereas black has 20 pawns and four other pieces. White wins if Odin can reach one of the corner squares; black wins if it surrounds Odin on all 4 sides. The pawns actually move the same way as chess queens, but pieces are captured by surrounding them on 2 sides (although some special pieces must be surrounded on 3 sides). The specials are chosen from the selection at the start of the game, and have a variety of abilities, some 'borrowed' from chess.<br><br>The presentation of this interpretation is similar to Battle Chess, with bold 3D graphics and lots of animation.

Equipped with these, they hope to destroy the evil Lord Fear. Treguard, the dungeon master of the Knightmare castle, appears as an oracle to help in their quest.<br><br>Knightmare is a role-playing game and the second videogame adaptation of the homonymous British television series. It is very similar to the games of the Captive series, as it was developed by the same author. As in those games the interface is mouse-based, clearly inspired by the Dungeon Master one: the left mouse-button interacts with the environment, while the right button executes character actions. Movement can be controlled by left-clicking on the movement buttons on the screen or by using the keyboard. Once a weapon or an object is equipped, clicking on it brings up a menu with its actions. Knives, for example, have a menu with "stab", "swing" and "hack". A empty hand shows a menu with "punch" and "kick". The wand shows a list of available spells.<br><br>The game allows saving at any moment, but only loads saved games through the start menu. This means that in order to load a saved game, the player has to reset the game or intentionally kill the party.

Description=In the mid-'70s, an unusual phenomenon took place: two Americans, Willie Crowther and Don Woods wrote the first text adventure game: it was the Original Adventure and was written in Fortran for a DEC PDP-10 and occupied more than 300 K of memory. It gathered a cult following from the elite programmers who knew how to connect to the data bank where it was located, and like all cults, it had its first "martyrs"; several important programmers were fired after becoming "addicted" to it, found playing it late at night while understood to be working overtime instead.<br><br>In the United States it was the base that inspired Scott Adams to begin with his famous adventures. In Great Britain, Peter Austin, founder of Level 9, the most prestigious English adventure game company, confessed to be impelled by it from his beginnings as a game designer (one of his first adventures was a version of the Original Adventure). In Spain, there was a similar story, since the first Spanish company dedicated exclusively to text adventures (Aventuras AD), made its reputation based on a game curiously called "La Aventura Original" (yes, based on the legendary one), the fruit of 8 months of investigation and work.<br><br>This version, aside from being in Spanish, has with several points worth mentioning, such as having more than 100 detailed locations with graphical illustrations; a special routine of exit descriptions (indispensable for guiding the adventurer through this complex world); and the possibility of using accents, "ñ"'s and opening interrogation and exclamation signs. As well, every object of your inventory is described in text and graphic form. The characters also use the PSI system, so they are not mere objects with human names, but will listen to you and respond -- but most importantly, will act according to how you treat them.

Description=Leisure Suit Larry in the Land of the Lounge Lizards is the first game in Al Lowe's Leisure Suit Larry series, largely inspired by the text adventure Softporn Adventure.<br><br>Larry, the game's protagonist, is a short, tacky, balding, leisure suit-wearing kinda guy who's constantly searching for his next score. His combination of stupidity and brashness gets Larry into trouble. The object is to get him out of trouble in traditional adventure fashion, finding and manipulating objects as you thread your way through the story line. The content is comedic and adult-oriented. A graphical interface is used with a text parser to input commands. Typical of Sierra games, progress is tracked through a set amount of points, awarded for advancement or minor actions.

Description=The sequel to one of the most famous games ever now has a much more significant plot. The Lemmings have split into 12 distinct tribes, each of which has their own landscape and their own cultural identity - they include Egyptian, Circus and Highland. However, Lemming Island is now in danger, and you must complete 10 levels for each tribe in order for them to reunite and reassemble the Talisman from the 12 pieces.<br><br>Across the 120 levels there are over 60 skills, although no more than 10 are in use on each screen. The Classic tribe has the ones form the original and is perhaps the best option for first-time players. <br><br>The others range from digging methods such as a scooper (diagonally downwards) and club basher (horizontal), building skills such as a planter (takes time to produce the desired raise to the landscape) and a sand pourer, and various methods of movement including a Pole-Vaulter and a Skater (the only Lemmings who can cross ice). Some of these are only subtly different to others, and their exact uses are unclear, but there are 4 Trainer levels where you can select any combination of skills and experiment.<br><br>Unlike the first game, you are rewarded for saving as many Lemmings as possible, rather than simply passing or failing. The ultimate aim is to save all 60 Lemmings through all levels, thereby earning a Gold Medal for that tribe - Silver and Bronze are also on offer. You can also go back over levels in the hope of saving more Lems. <br><br>Because there are 12 tribes, and you can switch between them at any point, you have to be stuck 12 times in order to be unable to progress. The game saves your progress rather than using passwords as in the first game.

Using a spaceship, his only hope to free the world is to destroy the planet Metallycha, where Xandrilia's heirs live.<br><br>Just like its predecessor, Lethal Xcess is a vertically scrolling shooter. The graphics are less fantasy-oriented than its predecessor, in favour of a combination between high technology and plantlife. Your spaceship no longer morphs according to powerups picked up, but the basic weapon system is still there, only expanded. Eight different weapon systems are now available, each of which can be upgraded multiple times. Other powerups are extra speed, smart bombs and autofire. The skull-shaped "power-down" also rear their ugly heads again.<br><br>Technologically, LX has also undergone great upgrades since its prequel. The playfield is now larger, and up to 150 sprites can be displayed on screen on the Atari ST, more on STE machines. Lethal Xcess manages to look just as good on an ST as on an Amiga, without ever looking like a bad ST port on the Amiga. In fact, the game was put out on dual-format disks which boot both on Amigas and Ataris. Another new feature is a simultaneous two-player mode.

Description=Sweet she is and sweets she wants. Young Lolly wakes up and has an incredibly appetite for candy. For chocolate, and for caramel and gingerbread, and for cookies and crisps and marshmallows and lemonade and bubblegum and jelly bears and ice and cream and sugar frosted chocolate bombs. All right, we’ve all had such moments. But Lolly is a doll. Animated by a stroke of lightning, she suddenly has life, a sweet tooth and a quest: Onward to the land where candy grows and the refrigerators never run out!<br><br>It’s a hostile world for small, innocent and rather hungry little dolls – that’s why you’ve got to help Lolly find her way through eight big levels in this jump’n’run game. After the escape from the toy factory, the way to the promised land leads through places like a ghost town, a snow world and even Lolly’s own cottony dreams. The way is far from safe: plenty of traps and monsters threaten a doll’s life, but good timing, athletic leaps and an ample supply of lollipops to fling at obtrusive enemies help mastering any challenge. In desperate situations, Lolly can take a snapshot with her pocket camera, which instantly destroys all opponents on the screen. Huge level bosses guard the exit of each world; defeating the mega-monsters requires specific tactics. <br><br>Fortunately, there is support: chests contain key items (to unlock different parts of each level), power-ups and plenty of sweets, of course. On the downside, the boxes may also yield harmful objects that jumble up Lolly’s controls or even hurt her. Tender dolls of that model can sustain three hits before they break apart. There’s a time limit for each level, so sucking popsicles in a corner won’t do. You cannot save the game, but you get a personal passcode after each level.

Description=Loom is an adventure game from LucasFilm. What sets Loom apart from other adventure games (in direct comparison with Sierra's) is its unique interface: you do not carry items around, but rather manipulate existing items through the use of spells. The spells themselves are woven through playing magical notes on a special distaff. Loom also features three difficultly levels, and differentiates them by changing the way the interface works: Standard features the distaff at the bottom of the screen but notes aren't written, whereas Expert doesn't have the distaff and you have to replay the spells by hearing alone.<br><br>In Loom you play the role of Bobbin Threadbare, a young man from the Guild of Weavers who just turned 17. Although you do not know why, you are outcast from the guild and blamed for the lack of prosperity in recent times.<br>After the Council of Elders is attacked and the Elders are turned into swans, you as Bobbin must set forth on a journey to find the swans and try to restore order to the Guild of Weavers.

Description=A puzzle game where the main goal is to make loops! Random pieces are presented over a board, including simple lines and corners as well as S bends and other warped shapes, of varying sizes. It is up to the player to link them up in a loop form, then moving on to the next level. Pieces can be placed on any empty space on the grid, and rotated into one of the four main compass directions.<br><br>Any pieces which are not part of the finished loop when a level is completed are left on the screen, so there is value in playing towards 2 distinct loops, to ensure that you have options depending on which pieces are drawn - unlike Pipe Dream there are no clues as to which pieces are coming next.<br><br>Three play modes are available, two of which can be played with two players. Game A is freestyle - simply make loops, gaining extra points for size and style. <br><br>Game B is about unlocking bonus boards of the game by reaching a certain score. and uses a bonus multiplier method depending on loop difficulty.<br><br>The third mode of play begins with an already made loop and then removes random pieces of it, so the player has to put them back in when they appear again. It is essentially a memory test and logic puzzle of fitting the pieces back as one remembers - although placing a piece where it seems to fit is also often effective.

Along the way you can use wizardry weapons and spells (there are 45 in total, created by combining ingredients) to conjure up mystical creatures like dragons and unicorns, but unfortunately so can Torquemada. Worlds include marshlands, castles and forests.

Description=Master Mind is a simple clone of the classic board game with the same name. A color code is hidden at the top. You have 10 tries to figure it out by trying different color combinations. Black and white pins tell you if how many correct colors you have - white means that a pin is in the right place, black that the selection does include that color pin, but in a different place. By using logic you can crack the code!

Description=There was a massive wave of football management games in 1992, and this was Zeppelin's contender. It was licensed around the BBC's football highlights programme famed for its classic theme music. The standard options exist (such as training, transfers and tactics) but the control system is unique. A diary is presented on the table, and you have to drag the icons for the activities you want to focus that amount of time on. This not only makes the presentation and style unusual, but also accurately represents the limited amount of time a real manager has.

Unlike the previous version, this one's not in BASIC!<br><br>A new GUI greets users, called the "Davidson Student Desktop Interface"- this allows people to switch from one portion of the game to the next  without all that nasty _typing_.<br><br>The math is broken down into five subjects- addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and fractions/decimals/percents.  The game itself is broken into 5 activities-<br><br>Countdown- a flash-card style "game" with no scoring or timing.  A problem, with answer, is shown on screen- upon command, the same problem appears sans answer, and must be answered correctly.<br><br>Ignition- problems appear, and upon a correct answer, motivational messages and animations pop up.  The player has two chances to answer correctly, and receives a scoreboard at the end showing number of problems, number solved, etc.  (This scoreboard appears in the next two listed activities.)<br><br>Lift-off- problems appear, with answer, but missing an internal component (like 2 * _ = 12).  Three chances per problem are given to answer correctly.  Once again, there are encouraging messages and animations- and a certificate of achievement may be printed out.<br><br>Orbit- three problems appear on-screen with portions of each in boxes; these boxes may contain errors and need to be changed by the player.  Each correct answer earns a star, and the player can attempt to answer twice.  This one also can print a certificate of achievement.<br><br>Blasternaut- the action-oriented math activity- you control a Blasternaut that must get into a rocket aimed at the correct answer to a shown problem.  Bonus points are awarded if you can rescue floating Blasternauts- apparently slamming into them with the nosecone of a huge rocket constitutes help.<br><br>The math problems contained within aren't randomly generated, but are pre-written lessons (which are handily printed in the instruction manuals.)  Math Blaster Plus! can be used to create new lessons, can be used in a classroom setting to track individual students' performance, and can print stored lessons as paper-based quizzes/tests for more traditional (and more boring) use.

The three-click control system was used, whereby the first click starts the swing, the second sets the power, and the third sets draw or fade.<br><br>Beginner and Expert difficulty options are given - the latter mode has more pronounced draw and fade effects, making the timing of the third click even more crucial. You can also choose between regular and professional tees - in the latter option the distance on the holes is longer, and the computer doesn't choose the best club automatically. Because long drives aren't a crucial aspect of many of the holes, the Begginer/Expert setting is a bigger factor on your likely scoring.

Description=Mega Blast is a game based upon simple rules popularized by such classic titles like Dyna Blaster or Bomberman. A couple of players are placed in a maze and each of them have time-bombs at disposal. The goal is to eliminate adversaries; players can achieve this by detonating an explosive when enemy is in its range.<br><br>The walls and obstructions will initially make it difficult for you to move, but most of them are not resistant to explosions, so you can blast your way through. When you knock down a part of the maze, it may reveal a hidden bonus, like increased firepower, additional bombs, and so on. The most important thing, and the core concept of the game, is that bombs have delayed explosion time. You have to be very careful and pay attention where you place them, so that it won't turn out later that not only you did no harm to your enemy, but took your own life instead.<br>	<br>Mega Blast also introduces such new gameplay features as:<br><br>Flying bombs. The player has a possibility to throw them in four directions. Bombs are bouncing off themselves and screen edges, exploding when they reach other bombs' field of fire, or spontaneously, after some time. This offers many new possibilities and enriches gameplay strategy.<br><br>Bonuses. Apart from standard bonuses (prizes found under destroyed walls) such as increased fire range, or additional bombs, the game introduces surprise items. Those may have a positive effect (ability for the player to walk through walls, increased moving speed, unlimited fire range) as well as a quite undesirable one (bombs spontaneously falling out of player's hands, exchange of places with another character, or mixed up controls).

On the roof of your buildings you can put protectors like archers, gunmen, boiling oil men, and later on even laser turrets. If you send a team of unarmed men into an unoccupied square, they will build an additional base there, with larger armies completing this more quickly.<br><br>Later on higher levels, you'll also build mines and factories, as you'll need to dig a certain material for higher level weapons, depending on whether the area you're on is rich with a certain material or not. With each next level, you'll start from a higher technology level and be able to progress to one higher level up then the at previous level.<br><br>If there is more then just one enemy, you can make an alliance until you crush the other one - three of you can form an alliance against fourth enemy. For what its worth, a certain numeric level of defence is always stronger from the same level of attacker, and men that are not armed (conscripts) can only kill enemy soldiers, not destroy or attack enemy fort.<br><br>The main thing as it always is in strategy games is to be the sole survivor and lead your men to victory, experimenting on vicious technologies, equipping your men, making a perfect soldiers out of them, produce shields, weapons, planes... to dominate the world and crush your opponents. <br><br>You can do the battling only in a certain quadrant, but don't be long as your men will automatically start building the fort, and it will be at the bottom of age level and you'll need to invent everything for that one again.

Description=If you're bored of racing Formula 1 cars, rally cars or MotoGP bikes in their natural habitats, the Micro Machines series could be for you. It involves racing miniatures representing particular vehicle types across a particular terrain found around the house. The Sports Cars race on the desktop, 4x4s in the sandpit, Formula 1 cars on a snooker table, and so on.<br><br>These levels were packed with variation. The Snooker tables has the track painted on, although this is open to deviation (as are most levels), and had you racing through the pockets and across the rim of the table. Tanks raced as well, with the chance of shooting out your opponent if they got directly in front of you. The desktop levels include binders to jump across, pencil-sharpeners to avoid, and lots of visual jokes in the open homework.<br><br>Viewed from overhead with small graphics, the races include up to 4 cars. In one player challenge mode you race through the 21 tracks in a set order, selecting your 3 opponents as you go along (adding a fair amount of strategy - ideally you should aim to eliminate the better CPU cars early on), eliminating one after every third race (assuming that you can finish in the top 2 of a race within your 3 lives). If you win 3 races in a row without using a continue you get a time-trial race which can earn you an extra life.<br><br>The real innovation of the game was in the multiplayer modes. You started with 4 points each, and when one car gets far enough ahead to force the other car off-screen, the slider moves in their favour. Once it reached the end (which involved beating them 4 times more than they beat you) you win the level, although if 3 laps were completed, the person leading at that point is declared the winner - with a sudden death play off if scores are level. 9 of the tracks are available in this mode, although you can also play this Head to Head system as a 1-player game across all the tracks.

Rotating barriers, light bulb switches and locked sections must all be taken into account, but there are also magic balloons later on. All this must be done within a time limit, and directing the beam back into itself causes overloads and must be avoided, Tron-style.

Description=Misja Harolda: Zaginiony w systemie (Harold's Mission: Lost in the system) is a point-and-click adventure game. Although his harmless looks may fool you at first, know that Harold is a mercenary assassin - and this time he is hired to get rid of Virus, who is terrorizing the world of Pixels. As these names may suggest, the action takes place in a fantasy-like interior of a computer, which happens to look - to our surprise - more like a run-down town than a cyberpunk "information highway".<br><br>This point'n'click adventure features conversations with dialogue options - wrong choices may even lead to your demise. Another thing that makes it "Sierra-like" is that it also keeps track of your score.

In some cases furniture can be used to your advantage. <br>The whole game is similar to Impossible Mission, requiring lots of logic, puzzle-solving and structured thought.

This version utilizes Sierra's SCI game interpreter and features enhanced graphics and sound.<br><br>The gameplay remains the same as the previous version; all of the nursery rhymes in Mother Goose Land have become mixed up! Your goal is to set things straight by locating missing items for each of the fairy tale characters in the land. When wandering around the land you can talk to the different characters (each from a different nursery rhyme) to find out what item it is they need; for example, Little Bo Peep is looking for her sheep and Jack Be Nimble lost his candle stick. The items are scattered about the land, and when you locate one pick it up and return it to the appropriate character. When successful, the complete nursery rhyme will play with the lyrics appearing on screen. You can only carry one item at a time, so you may need to remember where you spotted or dropped items not being carried! Also, each time the game is played objects will be in a new location. Included with the game is a map of Mother Goose Land which may help you locate the different fairy tale characters.

However, if you choose to play with only one player/knight, the other three will be the computer rivals. Wandering through the map, you can visit enchanted places, towns where you can buy equipment or try your luck in gambling, but mostly visited places on the map will be cabins which represents the places where certain enemy beasts are. Each spot has about two or more beasts which after defeating them can be rewarding in a certain way, depending on game's randomize placement.<br><br>Also, for example, if the place has three beasts and you kill two before you die, next time you (or some other player) go back there, there'll be only one beast left to fight. It's also possible for two players to run into each other and, once defeating the other, the one who prevails can steal the other player's money and/or weapons. Thus, searching for the moonstone begins, but that's only half of the story. The rest unfolds once you find it.

Description=This platform game challenges you to guide a mouse around a screen collecting goodies - varying from cheese to cakes to balloons. You will have to jump over flowers, dodge bouncing balls, dinosaurs and dinosaurs amongst other things - contact with any of these loses a life. Movement is achieved along ledges, via clouds, moving platforms and up ladders. Short falls can be withstood, but larger ones (or heavy landings from jumps) are fatal. Once they have all been collected you must reach the door, doing all of this within the time limit, depicted by a picture of a diffusing bomb

To do this, you must get through the game's eight stages, with over ten sectors like the junkyard, subway, drug lab, nursery, downtown, Sunset Strip, and even the corporation, where Mr. Big resides. In order to get through the stages, you are required to collect a number of safe cards, and insert them in the slot next to the stage exit.  Each sector includes a map, and should be easy to read. For example, the blue or red dots represent you, and the white dots are the missile launchers, while the "E" indicates the exit.<br><br>Your mission ain't going to be easy, as you will come face-to-face with enemies including the canine mutts, Das Lof Gang, Dr. Spike Rush, Joe Rockhead, Kinky Pinky, Sgt. Skyhigh, HQ Posse, and Mr. Big himself. You have two ways you can deal with them: either put a bullet in them or make arrests. Furthermore, they will try to blow you up the minute they see you. Fortunately, you're armed with a shotgun and missile launcher, but these both have a limited supply of ammunition. If your bullet counter reaches one, you can only fire one bullet at a time, so you need to find some more. Also, it is important not to waste all of your missiles: you might need them later when you deal with later enemies like Mr. Big. You are also backed up by a chopper and a mean shiny street machine.<br><br>More often than not, when you blow up enemies, you can pick up several items that they drop, including drugs, money, ammunition, missile launchers, and if you're lucky, safe cards.  Even if you got the safe card and can pass the level, you can keep blowing up enemies to score more points. According to the game, this game is for training purposes only, so you will not get employed by your local DEA office. Is this what the DEA does every day: go on rampages?

Each computer was stored in a separate HQ. During the North-South Wars of 2057-2065 one of the HQs was infiltrated by commando units, which lead to the creation of an even more secure and powerful super computer called Nemac IV stored in a high-tech bunker deep underground. Nemac IV controls all the automated military arsenal in the world. However, a problem occured: a simulation meant to test Nemac IVs capabilities went horribly wrong when the super computer didn't notice that it was only a simulated assault on its physical systems in the bunker. This lead to the computer assuming its own makers were its enemies. Now it's up to the player to stop Nemac IV from launching its nuclear arsenal on its own troops before it's too late.<br><br>Nemac IV is a first person shooter where the player remotely controls a FIKM-7 robot and has to destroy Nemac IV's reactor core at the bottom of the bunker. To defend against the enemy drones, the player has a chaingun, a plasma gun, grenades and bombs. Unlike other FPS games, weapons don't have to be picked up, but they are instead available right from the start. The player only has to ensure a full stock of ammo. The weapons can also be fired simultaneously by pressing their individual fire buttons all at once. Besides ammunition, bonus health can also be picked up.<br><br>The levels contain doors which are sometimes locked by a key code that can be obtained at a computer. Nemac IV also contains small puzzles, where after pressing a switch, the player has to find the shortest route to the respective door before it closes again. To aid the player in navigating the 40 levels, a auto-map can be overlayed on top of the game screen.

Description=One day, a kiwi tribe was having fun and games outside the zoo, only to be kidnapped by the evil-minded Leopard Seal, who plans to sell them at the black market. Fortunately, during the kidnapping process, Tiki, leader of the tribe, managed to escape the sack, and her job is to rescue Phee-Phee and the other kiwis scattered around New Zealand, and are held in cages in various locations that include Auckland, Rotorua, Waitomo Caves, Strait Cook, and Mt. Cook. <br><br>If Tiki doesn't rescue a kiwi in a limited amount of time, the devil will appear and try to kill her. When Tiki reaches the outskirts of each city, except Strait Cook, there is a boss waiting to meet Tiki, and kill her by using their own choice of weapons. Also making the rescue mission difficult are several nasties that attempt to throw their own weapons, like bombs and arrows, at her. To defeat these enemies, Tiki shoots at them using her crossbow and arrows. More often than not, when Tiki shoots at enemies, they will leave behind pieces of fruit that she can pick up for points. However, it is likely that Tiki may get other weapons or the letters E, X, T, E, N, and D. Collecting all these letters will result in an extra life, and as for the weapons, they include laser shots, bombs, and fireballs. <br><br>In some levels, a few areas are located further up than just left or right, and the only way that Tiki can go up is by snatching something off the enemy that gives her the ability to fly up. Other areas are underwater, and when Tiki goes underwater, her oxygen  meter decreases, so she has to rise up to the surface again to restore her oxygen levels. Apart from her own weapons, Tiki is able to squirt water at enemies if she gets to the top of the water.

There are two courses, plus a hidden 9-hole course on Mars with reduced gravity, with match play and stroke play options against one of 8 varied-difficulty computer players.<br><br>The control system is quite unusual, as the strength of the shot is chosen before you start the swing, but you have to click within a range to activate the shot, and this range is narrower if your shot is intended to be more powerful. An extra click can be made to add wrist snap, which increases the shot's power. The wind calculation is more complicated than most games of the era, and the rough is harder to play out of than usual, as you can't make slight stance adjustments easily.

Many dreamt of conquering the land, becoming the Shogun and ruling the entire country. One of those daimyos was the ambitious Nobunaga Oda, a merciless ruler and a renowned strategist. Players take on the role of Nobunaga Oda or one of many other daimyos to try to conquer Japan. <br><br>Nobunaga's Ambition is a turn-based strategy game which can be played in different modes. Gameplay is similar to Koei's better known Romance of the Three Kingdoms game. Players begin by selecting either a 17 regions scenario or a larger 50 scenario. Then, the player must select a daimyo, each of which is rated attributes in several categories; Age, Health, Ambition, Luck, Charm and IQ. As the game progresses, these values change depending on events in the game. The age value represents a time limit of sorts, as an elderly daimyo becomes increasingly likely to die of old age or sickness.<br><br>During each of turn (one per season), players can issue one of several commands from a menu. They include: Recruiting new soldiers, Training the army, Buying  Weapons, Increasing Peasant morale, Forming alliances or Hiring Ninjas to bribe &amp; assassinate. When one player attacks another, there is a war fought over the defender's region. Battles are fought in an overhead-view hex battle map. Each player takes turn moving units and issuing orders, which include attack, move, bribe and surrender. The goal is to defeat all of the enemy units (or force them into surrender). Army units each have a certain weakness against other types of enemies, and are also affected by the terrain.

Description=No Greater Glory puts you in the shoes of Abraham Lincoln or Jefferson Davis during the American Civil War. You make the great strategic, political, and economic decisions that will determine the fate of the American people for centuries to come. You will lead the government, mobilize the armies, pick the generals, and guide their movements. The epic struggle will ebb and flow - from Northern Virginia to Southern Louisiana, from St. Louis to Jacksonville, Florida. In the end, victory will come because of your strategic skills, your economic management, and your political acumen. No Greater Glory is an all-embracing simulation of national leadership during one of America's greatest crisis.

Description=The official description for Noiz2sa is "abstract shootem up game", and indeed it is. Noiz2sa takes the mechanisms of the "mania shooter" (the modern kind of shoot'em'up with extreme amounts of bullets on the screen at the same time) and removes all graphical touches. Instead, all graphics are rendered in flat polygons.<br><br>Your goal is to fly your ship through ten abstract levels while avoiding being hit by the barrages of enemy bullets. Unlike orthodox shooters, your ship is only vulnerable at its very core, the "sweet spot" if you will. As long as the trajectory of enemy bullets doesn't cut through the core of your ship, they will pass through you without hurting you. In order to better navigate the bullet clusters, you have a slow-down key which slows down your own movements so that you gain more precision.<br><br>Shooting down enemies makes them release green stars which give you bonus points, but no weapons upgrades or smart bombs are available; the goal is simply to survive using your plain cannon. In addition to the ten normal levels, there are four endless levels, where the aim is to survive as long as possible, thereby gaining a higher high score.<br><br>Noiz2sa makes use of the special BulletML markup language for defining bullet patterns.

One day, an evil being finds out the secret of the energy produced within the deserted planet of Kobaia, and he does not intend to use that power for the good of his fellow man. Warriors from all the planets in the system set out to stop him. However, being descendents of the warlike mankind, they will not hesitate to fight each other as well...<br><br>With this premise, Olofight is a futuristic beat'em'up. Eight characters are available to choose from, each with their own special powers. Apart from the usual kicks, jumps and punches, which are accessible through a simple system tailored for one-button joysticks, four special attacks are available by loading a power meter. These attacks are expendible, though, so once the allotted number of attacks have been used up, the fighters will have to rely on their conventional powers. When an opponent is defeated, you can learn special moves from them, and customise your moves before matches.<br><br>Four one-player modes are available: <br><br>1. The story mode takes you through the entire character gallery one at a time. The survival mode does the same but doesn't reset your life bar at the beginning of each fight; the challenge here is how many opponents you can defeat in a row.Time attack mode gives you a set time limit to finish your opponents.Single battle lets you fight any character you want and then return to the menu.<br><br>Of course, a two-player mode is also available.<br><br>The developers of Olofight put a lot of emphasis on technicalities. The game uses a lot of colours, more than is usually available on an AGA screen (early previews made claims of using the HAM-8 mode with 262 144 colours, which would be a world first). All characters and backgrounds are raytraced, as in Rise of the Robots, and the background features both several layers of parallax scrolling and perspective distortion on the ground.

Description=This is an unusual take on the football management game, which features virtually no statistics. Up to four managers can join in, to lead their chosen team through the World Cup, from qualifying to the actual tournament. Tactics and training are hugely important due to the game's short time frame.<br><br>The players each have individual personalities, and these have been factored in during the game. Sometimes players will drink too much, fall in love, or have personality clashes with their team-mates or with you, all of which have to be factored in. The press will ask you loaded questions, so be careful how you answer.<br><br>At half-time in each match you can single out a particular player for praise or criticism - if the team feels that you were unfair, their performance might fade. The World Cup is emulated accurately, other than having 2 points for a win instead of 3. The colourful match graphics and oil-painted stills are the same in style as those in the League Edition.

It uses an enhanced version of the Rotoscape system first used in Creative Materials' earlier Rotox: the own plane is seen from the top and when steering left or right the polygonally rendered background rotates around it. A new addition is the ability to change altitude. <br><br>The game consists of several missions, each with a specific goal like destroying an enemy cruiser or power plant or defending an airfield from enemy fighters. Before a mission, the Harrier can be armed with a variety of weapons, including air-to-air and air-to-ground missiles as well as two types of bombs. Standard armament is a forward-firing cannon with unlimited ammunition. A radar screen and a map help finding the enemy during a mission. Fuel is limited, but in some missions in-air refueling is possible. While the Harrier can survive a few hits, it can also be repaired (and refueled) after mission's end. Sometimes it is also possible to make a mid-mission resupply landing at a friendly base.

The gameplay varies every one or two missions. In some missions, you are driving a jeep or controlling a boat, while in others, you are walking while you're shooting. You have a limited supply of ammo, and a limited supply of rocket bombs, but you can always stock up by shooting down crates falling from the sky, or by killing a cat or dog that get in the line of fire. Also from crates, you can get special items like bulletproof vests, rocket bombs, and different weapons.<br><br>You also have a life bar to worry about. If you're shot at by soldiers, or if rocket bombs or grenades are thrown at you, you 'll lose energy, and once you're energy is depleted,  you lose one of your three lives.

Description=Pick 'n Pile is a Tetris-style puzzle game. On each level there are a variety of symbols arranged in columns on the screen. By moving the symbols around, you need to create columns which contain identical symbols; once all the symbols in a column are the same, that column disappears. Your goal is to earn points and complete the levels by making all of the symbols on the screen disappear. Occasionally, you may become stuck with a symbol that doesn't match anything onscreen; when this happens, you can call for an additional symbol to drop onto the screen. However, as the symbol which appears is random you may need to create quite a few symbols before the one you need appears. Each level has a time limit in which it needs to be completed; run out of time and you lose a life; lose all lives and the game is over.<br><br>In addition to the regular symbols, there are also some special objects on the screen which may help or hinder your progress. These include bombs which destroy several symbols at once, blocks which may get in the way or be arranged to help out, death heads which diminish time more quickly, and flower pots which can't be moved.

Description=Each level of this abstract puzzler challenges the player to set up a network of pipes to allow an unspecified substance known as 'flooz' to flow through as many of those as possible. The pieces are offered in random order, and there are seven different types - straight lines going horizontally or vertically, corners rotating in each of the four directions, and cross-over pieces which carry the flooz straight across horizontally and vertically. Each of these can be entered from either side. When the flooz hits a gap, or a piece which the previous piece can't flow into, the pipe is finished.<br><br>Before the flooz starts flowing from its randomly-selected starting position, the player has several seconds to start placing pieces. They can be put down anywhere. However a situation that can often occur is there will be a long and complex piping arrangement set up, yet a gap somewhere remains to be filled. Players are able to  replace a piece with another in the same square (to make it easier to flow the flooz that way), but for a slight scoring penalty.<br><br>Bonuses are awarded for looping the flooz through both sides of at least 5 cross-over pieces, or passing the flooz through every square on the screen. Later levels have some squares on the grid blocked off, a few gaps in the side-wall (allowing flooz to thread to the other side of the screen). After every four levels there is a bonus game for points, in which the player can only place the pieces in the lowest open space in each column, similarly to the board game of "Connect 4".

Before you open it, however, you have to buy furniture, decor and floors (there's a huge choice); hire some cooks and waiters; add some pizzas to your menu, and buy ingredients (you can buy at various shops, which offer various quality of the ingredients). Once this is all ready, you can open your first restaurant and then advertise it via fliers, billboards, newspaper or TV ads. <br><br>Creating your own pizzas, either to include into your menu or to take part in pizza-making competitions, is an important part of the game. You begin with an empty dough, and you're free to add a lot of various vegetables, meat, fruits or herb onto it. Remember that various people like various ingredients - if your restaurant is in a district populated mostly by kids, you can expect that a pizza made of sweet things will be popular. Also, specific ingredients rise and fall in popularity; if the newspaper announces that pineapples are bad for health, then sales of your Pineapple Pizza might plummet!<br><br>But while earning money as a honest citizen can be fun, it's even more exciting to get involved with the Underworld and buy weapons to devastate your competitor's restaurant, or do missions for the Mafia (which usually involve picking up something at a specific place at a specific time, and bringing it somewhere else at a different time). But beware, as this can bring you problems, either from the law or from the Mafia itself.

Each level finishes with an enemy with eyes shooting at you, and from level 3 there are teeth mounted in front which fire at you.

Description=A variation on the basic Breakout theme of having a bat at one end of the screen, using it to direct a ball into hitting each of a grid of blocks. In this adaptation the game is unusually played from left to right. Your task is not to eliminate every block, but to gain access to the back wall, by removing the blocks in front of it, and hit it 10 times, at which point you can go through it onto the next screen.<br><br>Sets of 8 screens are grouped together, and when you lose the ball on that level you get hurtled back through the previous ones (an idea seemingly taken from the MSX game Break In) at high speed. If you manage to catch the ball on one of them, you can continue from that level, trying to force the ball back through the end of the level, and get back to where you were.<br><br>On each level, the value of the different colours of blocks varies - the points schedule is listed a the side of the screen. Some blocks score onto your bonus rather than directly, others require multiple hits to be removed, and most sets of blocks will regenerate once all are removed - which gives you a chance to increase your score, and also adds points to your bonus.<br><br>The levels also contain a variety of bonus bricks, which are revealed as you remove the blocks on top of them and must be hit again to activate. These include bonus multipliers, extra balls, transformations to the ball's physics, and extra lives. There are 5 skill levels, and 2 players can play alternately.

There is an overwhelming amount of special blocks altering environment and ball physics, graphical effects in every corner, and semi-randomised music.<br><br>Apart from the levelset, the game engine has been revised. A new two-player &quot;squash&quot; mode is available. If you don't have a friend to play against, the computer will analyse your skill level and create a balanced drone player for you to spar against. A new &quot;wheel of fortune&quot; block gives you the chance to earn high point values when the ball lands in a trap block. Two other new block types are the teleporter blocks, which transport your ball to another place on the screen, and a block which diverts the ball in a straight line to the left at high speed.

After the trial, Sonny's application to the Homicide division was accepted and proposed to Marie, who had her prostitution charges dropped and started a new life away from the streets. Life was good... until Baines escaped, taking advantage of a low-security prison and an inexperienced correctional officer. Sonny is now in danger from a vengeful Baines and is saddled with his new chain-smoker partner Keith. Sonny goes to the field again to capture Baines, but things are about to get awfully personal...<br><br>Using Sierra's new SCI engine, the graphics are more vibrant than in the first game, but gameplay remains basically the same, with the player ordering Sonny to move to a place in the scene (either using the directional keys or the new mouse interface) and a parser interface to interact with the gameworld. Game sequences are more varied, and include a shooting range, an underwater search or searching the inside of an escape vehicle. The driving sequences are gone, and the player can relax while reading the chatter between Sonny and Keith as they move from location to location.<br>The approach to the game, however, is radically different. While the first (for a large part) is based on street police work, this sequel is oriented into forensics field work such as collecting evidences that link Baines into the happenings of the game.

Description=Powder is a sidescrolling "shmup" for the Amiga, made in a slightly cartoonish style much like many shooters for the SNES and PC Engine. The system is rather straight-forward; instead of a long range of power-ups, you have a reconfigurable ship, with five modes, which can be alternated by pressing the space bar or second joystick button. The first mode has spread fire firing forward at three angles, the second mode is a kind of gatling beam gun, firing a long blast from three rotating pipes. The third mode has a battery of rocket launchers firing in the direction you are travelling. This means that you can dive-bomb enemies or intercept them from below. The missiles have a very short range, though.<br><br>Powder has a graphical style reminiscent of Irem's old games (not R-Type, mind you), or Hudson's for that matter. Even though it is made for the OCS chipset, which was 13 years old when Powder was released, it features many small graphical touches such as reflections in windows and landscapes with a lot of detail. Each stage has several sub-bosses which halt the otherwise forced scrolling. Although the game is mostly horizontally scrolling, the playfield is at least one and a half screens high, allowing for high manoeuvrability, and with certain portions of the game scrolling diagonally as well.

Description=The Powerdrome racing series is now into its 24th year of high-speed high-octane action. Why race on flat 2D circuits when you can charge through a multi-textured half-pipe in small aircraft? Typhoon Racing have taken up the challenge, and entered you in their machine.<br><br>There are 6 different circuits, with hazards including chicanes, tunnels and crusher gates. Shading to the sections marks out whether a corner or dive is coming up. There are 5 computer opponents to race against in one player mode, while a data link cable allows 2-player games.<br><br>Each planet has its own atmosphere, and your machine's filters will need to be set to take account of this. Rain on some circuits necessitates a pitstop for a changeover. You are armed with afterburners, which can provide a speed use in open air but should not be overused. The Amiga version allows you to adjust the sensitivity of the controls - either way, joystick is easier to use but mouse is seen as ultimately being faster.

The squares are split into four different colours, which each represent a particular broad Trivial Pursuit-style subject area. The question has four possible answers, and a correct answer allows you to move your piece one space, perhaps onto one of the four white teleport squares (which randomly places it on one of those four squares).<br><br>When a piece lands on the same square as an opposition piece, a challenge ensues, which plays out like a quiz show, with questions asks in quick fire and the first player to answer gaining a point if right and losing one if wrong. The losing piece drops down a skill level.<br><br>Once a piece reaches 25 Wisdom Points, it can mutate up a skill level - this makes it harder to beat, but makes the questions it faces harder.

The blocks quickly reappear though, which can be fatal if they trap him, but can also be used by the cunning player to trap an enemy. <br><br>Not all the platforms and transporters on the levels are visible, which guarantees an element of Rick Dangerous-style trial and error. You have six lives, which isn't much considering that failing to complete a level within the time limit costs a life, and contact with enemies is costly (you can't drill through them Worms-style)

Description=Profezia is set sometime during the Middle Ages, in a mountain area between the two Italian regions of Abruzzo and Lazio. The player takes control of a mercenary who has been hired to retrieve a golden crown from the castle of Capistrello, where Duke Attilio intends to use it on an ancient Pagan rite.<br><br>Profezia is an adventure game with a multiple-choice interface: as opposed to classic adventures where the player is free to roam around the game world (or part of it), the storyline in Profezia develops automatically. Whenever an action is to be taken, the player is presented with a set of choices, which will affect the rest of the adventure.<br><br>It is worth noting that there is no unique path to complete the game: the player may follow alternate branches, provided that the actions which follow are coherent with their previous choices.

Your boat is fitted with bombs, which can be placed so as to force the other boats to run over them, gaining you points. Extra bombs and fuel litter the course, often close to the banks, which you must avoid contact with, for fear of crashing your boat.

A helicopter flies overhead, dropping bombs which you must avoid, and often obscuring your view.

Description=An enemy with the codename ''Quake'', which is believed to come from another dimension, is using teleporter gates to invade Earth. The player takes the role of a nameless soldier who arrives at his base only to find out Quake has overrun it and killed everyone. Somewhere in the base there must be a teleporter to Quake's realm. The mission is clear: take the fight to the enemy, overcoming countless hordes of monsters, and exact revenge.<br><br>id Software's followup to Doom and Doom II, "Quake" is a first-person shooter. Its main technological innovation is the use of a true 3D engine - the levels themselves as well as the enemies are polygonal. This not only allows for more natural level designs and character animations, but also for more realistic lighting and the inclusion of simulated physics that have an effect on gameplay: grenades can bounce off walls and around corners, for example.<br><br>In single-player mode, gameplay consists mainly of proceeding through the levels (spread over four distinct episodes) in search of an exit, killing everything that moves. Interaction with the game world is reduced to a minimum: since there is no use key, buttons are pressed by running into or shooting at them. As in id's earlier games, many secrets are waiting to be discovered, including a few hidden levels.<br><br>Unlike Doom's rather straightforward design that couples futuristic environments with demonic imagery, the theme of Quake's levels, enemies and weapons is not so easily pinpointed. While each episode begins in a futuristic military base (with a technological 'slipgate' as the level exit), later levels take place in environments inspired by medieval fantasy and gothic horror (castles, dungeons and caverns) and the player passes through magical portals to advance. In a departure from Doom's colorful environments, all Quake levels are dominated by earth colors.<br><br>The enemies conform to the mishmash of designs: there are human opponents armed with shotguns and energy weapons in the early levels, while the later levels include medieval knights, ghosts, zombies, ogres (armed with grenade launchers and chainsaws) and some more unearthly beasts. The player's weapons, while relatively modern, all have a low-tech feel.  Besides a (bloodstained) axe, there are shotguns, nailguns, rocket and grenade launchers and the Thunderbolt, which discharges electrical energy.<br><br>Quake was one of the first games playable natively over the Internet in addition to LANs. The single-player levels can be played cooperatively, but the game is most famous for its deathmatch mode. One-on-one duels, team play and free-for-all competition are possible. The emphasis is on fast reaction and skillful maneuvering through the levels. All of the single-player maps can be used as arenas, but the game also comes with six maps especially designed for deathmatch.

Description=From the Racter FAQ:<br>In 1984, William Chamberlain published a book called "The Policeman's Beard is Half Constructed" (Warner Books, NY. 0-446-38051-2, paper $9.95). The introduction claims: "With the exception of this introduction, the writing in this book was all done by computer." <br><br>The authorship is attributed to RACTER, originally "written in compiled BASIC on a Z80 with 64k of RAM."Racter strings together words according to "syntax directives", and the illusion of coherence is increased by repeated re-use of text variables.  This gives the appearance that Racter can actually have a conversation with the user that makes some sense, unlike Eliza, which just spits back what you type at it.  Of course, such a program has not been written to perfection yet, but Racter comes somewhat close.  <br><br>Since some of the syntactical mistakes that Racter tends to make cannot be avoided, the decision was made to market the game in a humorous vein, which the marketing department at Mindscape dubbed "tongue-in-chip software" and "artificial insanity".

The player has the opportunity to name his civilization and those of his (up to three) AI opponents before he begins his attempt at galactic domination.  The game is very bare bones by modern standards: the 2D galaxy map is marked only by planets and their names in few different colors.  Also, there is no diplomacy and no player control over tactical combat.<br><br>What remains is a hard-core game of grand strategic and economic production.  The player must tweak his planets, build ships, research new tech levels, and deploy fleets.  A nice feature of the game is that just about all of the underlying dynamics can be altered and customized by the player, which means that Reach for the Stars is infinitely replayable.

You take control of Soviet detective Ivan Danko (played by Schwarzenegger), who travels to Chicago in pursuit of the fearsome Georgian drug lord Victor Rosta. <br><br>The game is essentially a side-scrolling beat'em up in the vein of Vigilante. As Danko, you proceed across four levels which follow the movie's original setting, where you are constantly attacked by members of the Cleanheads, a group of drug-dealers who are in business with Victor Rosta. To eliminate hostiles you can either punch them (slow but long-ranged) or head-butt them (close-ranged but faster). The only defensive move available is crouching, so as to avoid being hit - there is no jumping or any other evasive tactics. Occasionally, you can get hold of a handgun and fire six shots at the villains. Other items you can pick up will boost your health, make you temporarily invulnerable or give you access to bonus levels.<br><br>One peculiarity of Red Heat is its widescreen-like game area, and the fact that all characters are drawn from the waist up. This may find partial explanation in the first level, set in a Russian sauna where, as in the original movie scene, all characters are not wearing clothes.

The game scrolls sideways, and has sections where precision jumps are required, either to clear rivers or collect bonuses. You carry a dagger to deal with the enemies, and must avoid contact with them. When killed, they leave coins to be collected - these are spent in the shop sections. Death loses you most of your coins, but they can usually be retrieved if they land on solid ground - making it better to be killed in combat than by drowning.

Description=Road Rash is an aggressive motorcycle racing game where the player assumes the role of a biker who takes part in a series of illegal races across the U.S.A. Starting at the back of the pack the objective is always to finish first on a linear course, overtaking the other bikers. This is achieved by driving very well or by playing it dirty, knocking opponents of their bikes using clubs, crowbars or your bare hands. The other racers fight back in a similar fashion and there are also hazards. All the races take place on the regular road with normal traffic (in both directions) and the cops, as well as occasional oil slicks and stray cows.<br><br>By winning races you can get promoted to a stronger division and earn cash with which you can buy a better bike. Whenever you're knocked off your bike or hit something you will have to run back to your bike and lose valuable time, plus your bike will suffer some damage. When the player crashes with cops nearby, it is possible to get busted and then you have to forfeit the race.<br><br>Like the whole Road Rash lineage, the game has arcade-like gameplay with no intention to be a motorcycle simulation. While the game has a two-player mode, this is not simultaneous.

Each action you choose advances the calendar by one day and you have until December to achieve your ultimate aim of superstardom - represented by a line graph which rises or falls depending on the performance of your band's releases.<br><br>Once your band has recorded their first album you can choose to release the single and/or the album. The single needs a video to go with it which costs varying amounts of cash depending on which director you choose. You can choose to go for publicity, but this can be risky as there is a chance that one of your rock stars will be in the papers as an ex-rock star who died in any of many strange ways (all that's missing is a 'bizarre gardening accident'). Publicity affects your sales directly and also affects the crowds who attend your gigs. You lose the game if either you run out of money, or all of your rock stars die.

The hits needn't all be inflicted at the same time, as it's possible to release them to move them out of the way.<br><br>When killed, each bad guy releases some kind of extra, ranging from points bonuses to various devices which can be used to kill other enemies.<br><br>Each level also contains a certain amount of fruit. If you can collect all of this (with some bad guys still alive - you move on immediately once they're gone) you enter a bonus game, in which each enemy's death results in one of the letters E,X,T,R and A being released - collect them all for an invaluable extra life.<br><br>In the Game Boy version the difficulty lies slightly lower because the player can use his wand even when climbing ladders.

Description=You control a battle tank (the Rotor) which hovers in a 2D-labyrinth. Gravity pulls heavily on the Rotor, making it fall towards the ground. As any contact with walls or enemies is deadly, your main task is to avoid that. You may rotate your tank freely and accelerate via an afterburner, thus manoeuvring through the corridors -- imagine a mix of Asteroids and Lunar Lander to get an idea of the physics.<br><br>Scattered throughout the 18 different fortresses are boxes. Shoot these open to find either a) Fuel: this will replenish your supply, which is drained by shooting and accelerating. b) Sun crystals: Collect all to finish the mission. c) Bombs. They will explode in 30 to 60 seconds, destroying your ship. You can avoid that by leaving the screen quickly, or by picking the bomb up; this earns you major credits, but your ship drops much faster due to increased weight. d) Pearls. Collecting these advance the upgrade counter by one to three steps; you may activate the current upgrade at any time, which will improve your rotation speed, engine strength, weapon, shield etc. Boxes are emptied by carefully flying very, very close to them and activating a tractor field.<br><br>As if gravity and accurate flying wasn't challenging enough, the game also confronts you with various enemies. All of these are immobile and fire in a straight line; the sheer mass of them makes avoiding the bullets a difficult task nevertheless. Apart from turrets, there are attractors and repulsors who'll smash you into walls, and force fields that need to be deactivated by finding and shooting a switch.<br><br>The tricky labyrinths together with the short supply of fuel, weight constraints and clever upgrade system make Rotor more a game of tactics and accuracy than arcade action. Wild shooting and careless flying will deplete your fuel in no time; you'll have to progress carefully to discern traps in time.

Description=R-Type is a side scrolling shoot 'em up best known for its extremely tough and strategic gameplay.  You control the R-9 spaceship as it launches a last-ditch effort to repel the evil Bydo empire.<br><br>The R-9 comes equipped as standard with a small gun which can only take down the smallest of enemies without firing several shots. By holding down the fire button, it can be loaded up so as to release a large burst of energy, eliminating all but the strongest enemies in its path. From time to time, pods will come flying in your direction. Upon being shot, they release an upgrade. The first one will invariably be the one called "The Force", which is a weapons pod that clings either to the front or the back of your ship, absorbing any enemy bullets or acting as a bumper with which you can fly head-on into them. You can also use it as an offensive weapon by firing it and pulling it back in. Mastering the Force is vital to surviving in R-Type, since it must be used both as protection against bullet clusters, as a remote controlled cannon, and in order to clear the screen from obstacles. Other upgrades give you target-seeking missiles or a bigger main gun. Different gun types, differentiated by their colour, serve different purposes. The blue one sends laser beams bouncing across the screen (good for tunnels), the red one fires straight ahead, and the yellow one follows any walls it may encounter (good for artillery emplacements).<br><br>The stages of R-Type are made in an organic style, certainly inspired by H. R. Giger's artwork for the Alien movies. When it came out, it was considered trend-setting since it broke off from the stereotypical sci-fi mould of other shoot'em'ups. In part, the levels themselves are your enemy, which is exemplified by the fourth, where spider-like creatures weave webs that cover the screen and block your path, or levels with intricate tunnel systems. Still, the levels are best handled with a combination of strategy and reflexes, without the memorisation that is required of R-Type's contemporary rival, Gradius.

In this turn-based strategic simulation you must choose a team of four of these from the 8 available, and take them to victory in five increasingly tough missions. Even before you get into the main gameplay, there is a lot of strategy involved in choosing weaponry, as they make different amounts of noise when used (reducing the stealth potential) and their ammunition is of varying weight.<br><br>In each turn you have limited action points per soldier, which must be used for all movement, firing and reloading moves. The maps are viewed isometrically, with a compass used to indicate the directions of movement, and where the incoming fire emanated from.

Description=Saint and Greavsie is a sports trivia game where one to four players have to answer sport-related questions. Players start by throwing a ball across a series of stadiums. To the left of these stadiums is a green bar, and the higher the green bar, the greater the distance the ball will go. <br><br>Depending on where the ball lands, the player has to answer three types of questions from one of four question packs. Home questions (worth one point) are generally related to modern football and are the easiest to answer. Away questions (worth two points) are generally related to football in the 1960s and '70s with teasers about 'golden oldies'. Finally, derby questions (worth three points) will test your knowledge of football trivia, and these questions are fun as well as factual. Players can choose to answer the question or pass onto the next player. If the player chooses to answer a question correctly, a penalty shootout is given which involves the player kicking a goal to score bonus points.<br><br>The winner of the game is declared after all players have completed 21 or 42 matches (when one league season is completed). The winner is the player who has the most points.

Description=An intermediary step in complexity between the brutally basic HAMURABI and more sophisticated modern titles such as Civilization, Santa Paravia and Fiumaccio ushers you into a Merchant Prince setting, governing over a 15th-century Italian city-state, competing with the savage forces of nature and against up to 5 (7 in some later versions) other players in the hot-seat, seeing who can rise through the ranks to claim titles from COUNT, to MARQUIS, GRAND DUKE (and, finally, H.R.H. KING.)<br><br>At its heart the game is, as are its predecessors, about bean-counting -- weighing your current reserves of grain (measured in steres) against your population's food demands, wondering how many gold florins the market price for your surplus will net, and how many hectares of land that'll permit you to purchase... and whether that investment will come back to haunt you the following turn if the weather shifts from feast to famine, when you have plenty of dirt and nothing growing in it to feed your grumbling populace.  However, the game cleans up real nice, and cute graphical depictions may help you to forget that your debauched Renaissance rule largely consists of moving debits and credits back and forth across a virtual ledger.<br><br>Varying difficulty levels help you find your own comfort zone in which to engage bad harvest conditions, worse real-estate prices and, worst of all, the endless appetites of what must amount to hundreds of thousands of rats, endlessly nibbling at your reserves.  Surplus capital can be sunk into blue-chip investments such as marketplaces and mills, palaces, cathedrals and private armies.  If, after commissioning them all, you find you don't have so much surplus capital after all, you can always cook the books by adjusting several different flavours of taxes, tariffs and customs fees... but tamper too much and your local economy will be stifled!<br><br>Nearly every downturn in this game has an equal and opposite check, or at least a balance, to keep it from demolishing your estate in a single swoop... however, early versions of this game, as with many titles of its era, may cruelly and arbitrarily cut your rule short with a random death.  All the more reason to carpe diem and do the best with what you've got, while you've got it.

Description=Most of the fundamentals of this game work in a similar way to Desert Strike. You pilot a helicopter or a three-barreled tank through 14 increasingly tough multi-phase missions, each of which is preceded by a full briefing and a shopping phase. <br><br>Before each phase you can enter the shop and upgrade your weaponry, paying with golden medals gathered during previous phases. Your starting weapons are the chain gun and rockets/tank shells. Every weapon has three upgrade levels. After that, you can decide how much ammunition for each weapon you want to load into your vehicle's weapon bays, switch between the tank and the chopper (which can only be done between phases, and some of them don't give you the choice), choose one of the three special weapons and adjust the fuel/armor/speed characteristics. All these preparations are surprisingly complex for a shooter like this, and a bad configuration can make the game really hard (no fuel in the middle of the desert, or a paper-thin armor are just two examples)<br><br>Missions are set in the desert and jungle as well as over the sea and in snowy regions. Most often your objectives are, obviously, to seek and destroy, while performing some rescue operations and gathering as much powerups as you can. The powerups consist of ammunition, fuel, medals, and others. A scanner is installed into the vehicle to guide you, as is a mapping system and a limited shield.<br><br>Unusually, the game only scrolls vertically even though you have full directional movement. When you rotate the direction the ground moves underneath you, ensuring a more realistic effect and smartly mimicking motion effects.

"Energy" plays an important role,  there's a constant amount in the game world and each object is worth a certain number of units - including you.<br><br>The object of each level is to absorb The Sentinel and Hyperspace to the next from his vantage point. <br><br>The Sentinel scans further round the landscape every few seconds - if you're caught in his gaze,  or rather the square you are standing on can be seen,  you'll have about 5 seconds to teleport to another location (or hit a key to teleport to a random location - which will never be higher,  and may be lower than your current level) before the Sentinel begins absorbing your energy,  when it reaches zero you will be destroyed. To travel a "robot hull" must be created on a visible square then teleported to,  making sure you absorb your old hull to avoid losing energy. Boulders and trees can also be created,  trees to block The Sentinels view and boulders can be stacked to gain higher ground. <br><br>There are a few other elements to the game - on later levels there will be other Sentries positioned around the landscape. If only part of you can be seen i.e. not the square you are standing on, a nearby tree can be changed into a "Meanie"  which will ultimately force you to teleport. There are 9999 levels in the game but the next level number is based on the current level + how much energy you have remaining.<br><br>Sentinel Returns is a remake very true to the original.

The goal of this futuristic sporting event is to seduce women (well, nubile females of various species) from different planets faster than the lothario Dr. Dildo does. This is achieved either by seducing them through old-fashioned questing and the solution of adventure-game puzzles or by thwarting the good doctor from obtaining certain items he needs in order to keep his groove on.  Faster, higher, stronger!

The player has to navigate through several areas filled with enemies and traps, collecting keys and activating triggers than open new areas or give Aarbron the means to overcome a sub-boss. The number of moves the player has at disposal is limited: duck, jump and only two attacks: punch and a flying kick.

However, there are also traps of objects that cannot be destroyed, and these require the player to jump, duck or move according the sequence. The player has only one life with 12 hit points that can be replenished by collecting some objects hidden in the level (like an off-route location or a under a megalith), which also contributes to the difficulty level.

Description=Originating in the arcades, Side Arms is a horizontally scrolling shoot ‘em up in which you control Lieutenant Henry (a second player can control Sergeant Sanders in some versions), armed with crude weaponry and protective jump-suits. They must save the earth from the mercenary invaders of Bozon. You must first reach Bozon’s territories, then wipe out its forces hidden in caverns and lurking in underground seas, before destroying the main invasion ship. Lots of extra weapons can be picked up, often with similar tokens to those in 1943 and some other Capcom titles. Most weapons can be shot either to the left or the right, giving you more range to launch attacks.

Description=This vertically scrolling shoot 'em up varies from the standard for this style of game, as it also features a degree of horizontal scrolling. The screen area moves across as you reach the edge of the screen and reveals a whole new range of enemies. These include lots of static turrets as well as cannon-fodder waves of enemies.<br><br>There are 6 levels and each level starts and ends with you travelling through a tunnel, and emerging on the other side faced with a new graphical setting, be it industrial, space or woodland. After clearing the last level the tunnel leads back to the first level, so there is no real ending to the game. There are no end bosses, instead each level ends with a more difficult part with a large ground structure and increased enemies and turrets. There are 3 difficulty levels to choose from, and a 2 player mode.<br><br>Interestingly, the game was not only released for Amiga and PC, but also as a coin-op  machine for arcades. The arcade version is identical to the Amiga version, the arcade PCB  even contains parts of the Amiga operating system.

Description=Civilization has the widest scope of any strategy game of its time. You are a leader of a nation. You begin in the Stone Age, and complete the game in the XXIth century (unless your civilization gets destroyed earlier). Your eventual goal is to become the dominant civilization in the world, either by wiping out everybody else, or being the first to get a space ship to Alpha Centauri.<br><br>As the nation's leader, you have many responsibilities. You have to build cities, and then micromanage them, constructing various buildings. Most of people in your cities will be working on the neighbouring lands to get food (without it, your city won't survive or grow), production (used to build military units and buildings) and trade (which can be exchanged for money, science (see below) or luxuries that make people happy. You decide how much trade you want to invest into each of these areas.) You have to make sure that your people are in a good mood; if they get too unhappy, the city will collapse into disorder, and won't produce anything until you fix the situation. <br><br>If you're ambitious, you can build Wonders of the World - epic constructions, such as the Pyramids or the Hoover Dam. Each Wonder is an unique thing, and only one of each can exist in the world. They give you a lot of benefits if you complete them, but they take a long time to build, and many of them will eventually stop working. <br><br>There are other nations in the world, and there are also barbarians, so you'll have to invest into the military to protect yourself and to attack. Sure, you can sign peace treaties with other nations, and even exchange scientific knowledge with them (although sometimes they'll demand tribute from you), but eventually you'll probably have to fight. You control each of your military units on the world map, attacking your opponents' units and cities (possibly taking over them). <br><br>Not all units are for combat though. Settlers are used to build cities, create roads (for easier travel of your units) and improve the land around cities, increasing production. Diplomats can be sent to foreign cities to negotiate with the other nations or create embassies, but they can also bribe enemy units to join you and conduct espionage and sabotage in the enemies' cities. Caravans can be sent to faraway cities to increase trade in their home city, and they can also help in building Wonders of the World. <br><br>Scientific progress is an important part of the game. The more science your cities produce, the faster you research new technologies. Initially, you'll be finding out about the wonders of Alphabet or Bronze Working, but late in the game you'll be researching Computers and Robotics. Most technologies give you some new units, buildings and other things, although some have more interesting effects - for example, after inventing the Automobile, you'll find out that your citizens started producing pollution. Pollution is a bad thing; if there's too much of it, global warming may occur. <br><br>How your cities prosper depends partially on the type of government that your nation has. Initially you're living in Despotism, but this can stunt growth of your civilization, so it's a good idea to switch to something else - Monarchy, Republic, Democracy or Communism.

Description=Sid Meier's Colonization is a strategy game which puts you in the role of Viceroy of the New World. You are sent by your King and country to establish colonies in the newly-discovered Americas that lie to the west. You face many of the same challenges that faced colonial organizers of the time-competition<br>from other Old World powers, strange native cultures, the problems of establishing profitable trade programs, and the problems of organizing an army from a rag-tag band of colonists.<br><br>The game begins with the European discovery of the Americas (1500) and continues until approximately the time of the American<br>Revolution (1800). In the beginning of the game you are given a trading/exploration ship and a small group of colonists. You have no knowledge of what lies ahead of your ship, so you must explore until you find a suitable spot to lay down your first colony. As your<br>colonies grow larger and larger, you inevitably encounter native populations and are confronted with competing imperial powers from the Old World.<br><br>Each of your colonies is populated by a number of colonists, who you can assign to various tasks. Some chop wood, mine for ore and collect plants outside the colony, some others stay inside to turn those raw materials into more valuable cargo - such as rum (made from sugar), coats (made of furs) or hammers (made of lumber). Hammers which aren't a cargo you can sell, but represent the speed with which you construct new buildings in your colony. Some colonists are specialists, and thus are more effective at a certain job. <br><br>The cargo you collect and produce is an important thing. You can take it to Europe to sell, and earn money to buy some other necessary things, hire colonists (though new, willing colonists appear in Europe by themselves) or buy ships and artillery. You can also trade it with the Indians or colonies of other nations. <br><br>You'll construct various buildings in your colonies. They have a lot of different functions: some of them can improve the speed with which you produce valuable cargo, others allow you to defend yourself from attacks more easily or construct ships and artillery. Some buildings require you to spend a number of valuable Tools when constructed, though you can make new Tools out of ore. <br><br>As you explore the land, you'll come across the Indian villages and some "places of interest" which can be investigated. A colonist that enters an Indian village can be welcomed with open hands, and the natives will reveal a map of nearby lands, or teach him a profession. Investigating places of interest has various consequences: sometimes you'll find nothing, sometimes you'll be killed for trespassing on ancient burial ground, but sometimes you'll find treasure! (Taking this treasure to Europe can be difficult though - if you don't have a sufficiently big ship, the King will agree to transport it for you... if you give him 50% of the gold). <br><br>To defend yourself from enemies, you'll want to have some military units. Just give a colonist a musket and he'll turn into a Soldier, give him a horse, and he's a Scout or a Dragoon. However, such a warrior is typically inexperienced, though he might gain military experience in battle. Artillery is also good at defense, but don't try to leave your colonies with it - in the open field, it is useless. <br><br>As you progress in the game, you'll feel that working for the King is getting more and more annoying, especially since he keeps raising your taxes, thus decreasing your income from sold goods. Your colonies produce "Liberty Bells", which increase rebel sentiment in the colonies. If the majority of colonists supports your yearning for freedom, you can declare independence. But when you do that, you'll have to deal with the King's expeditionary force arriving to teach you a lesson. If you manage to defeat all his incoming armies and emerge victorious from the American Revolutionary War, you've won!

Gather enough evidence through house search, wiretaps, etc. Decode any messages you discover to unravel additional clues. Each operation will be handled by multiple people. Figure out the crime BEFORE it happens and get enough evidence to find the true mastermind behind the whole thing... Then chase down and arrest the suspects via car chases or go into the house arrest the suspect yourself. Can you arrest all the masterminds? <br><br>Covert Action is best described as a secret agent simulator, with a heavy dose of puzzle and some top-down shooter action. You'll follow the hints all over the world, surveil suspect safehouses, apply wiretaps (which is a puzzle sequence), even go inside and check each and every drawer without arousing suspicion (by keeping VERY quiet). If you're discovered, you'll need to AVOID car chases or you'll end up shooting it out with the bad guys. You can also "tail" a suspect (with multiple cars) and see if you can find another safehouse or more headquarters to search for clues. You have silenced pistol (or Uzi) and three different types of grenades, plus other high-tech toys. As you get closer to the mastermind, the plot gets more intricate, timeline gets shorter, code breaking is tougher, and enemy harder to take out...

Drive your competitors out of business with buyouts and rate wars. Multiple types of resources to carry (roughly grouped as slow freight, fast freight, passengers, mail) and convert, own facilities to maximize profit (buy a steel mill and the conversion from iron ore to steel makes money for YOU). Use the latest available technology to your advantage (new locomotives). Your objective is to retire with a huge bonus (based on your company's assets) and become the President or the Prime Minister (depending on which continent). <br><br>The game is essentially a bird's-eye-view real-time strategy game with aspects of building and stock market manipulation. Each fiscal period is 2-years, which corresponds to 1-day of track time. Build different sizes of stations to take care of different local needs, create trains that switch consists at different stations and maximize throughput. Upgrade/retire/modify trains as times change. The faster the trains arrive, the more money they earn. Multiple options will keep you busy as each game is different.

He also has to collect enough "proof" of the aliens existence (brown coins left behind when they are jumped on), so his family members will help him when he meets a boss (characters such as Nelson and Sideshow Bob). This won't be easy since the Space Mutants are "using" human bodies as disguise. In order to discover who are the real Space Mutants, Bart must use his X-ray Specs.<br><br>The ways Bart can get rid of those objects sought by the Space Mutants are numerous. For instance, in the first stage, Bart must get rid of purple objects. He can dye them red, cover them, wash them, etc. Some even involve a little puzzle solving, like playing a trick on Moe to make him get out of the bar.<br><br>Bart also has some coins that can be used in many ways throughout the game, like buying things, getting devices operating, etc. Those coins are essential to solve some puzzles in the game.

You set off in your little submarine and board the ship where a horde of passengers desperately need your keen oversight and "shipsmarts".<br><br>In 60 levels you have to rescue as many passengers (dubbed the Dim Passengers) as possible. At the beginning the passengers fall through a tube in the level. Similar to Lemmings you have to find a way for the passengers to the exit of the level. In order to do so, you must blast hindrances such cargo boxes and bulkheads with bombs or, when no bombs are left, reposition the boxes with a crane. There are also conveyor belts in the levels. If the belt moves in the wrong way, the passengers either can't use it or may even be transported to their dooms, being dropped off into water, fire or steam jets. You can usually choose the direction of the belts by pulling a lever.<br><br>There are several types of scenarios that Kevin Codner (you) are faced with throughout the game. Of course the puzzles get progressively more difficult, involving things like patching up cracked pipes to stop a lethal jet of steam from cooking the distressed passengers. You can blast away obstacles and stack crates in creative manners. For instance, you can have them fall onto each other to form a bridge across a gap or to provide shielding from fire. This is usually done by hoisting them onto conveyor belts using a crane.<br><br>Each level has a certain "save limit", meaning you have to save at least a certain amount of passengers. This again is akin a bit towards Lemmings, and lots of levels have a built-in time limit, represented be water pouring into the compartment, rising ominously. When the water rises high enough, the passengers will get carried along with it, and they can only swim for a short period of time before getting exhausted and drowning, so you'd better be on time with some assistance.<br><br>At the end of each level you receive a password (again, Lemmings-style) so that you may pick up your game from the current level without having to progress through them all from the get-go.

The aim of the game is to blast everything in sight and try to grab more cash and prizes than the other guy. Toaster ovens, VCRs, fancy cars and luxury holidays are there for the taking... for anyone who can survive long enough to enjoy them.<br><br>Smash T.V. is an insane shoot-em-up from the brain of Eugene Jarvis, creator of Robotron: 2084. It retains that game's frantic style of play and two-joystick control method, but adds plenty of gore, violence, a hint of satire and that all-important two player mode.

Description=Space Harrier II follows (very closely) in the footsteps of its predecessor and involves you (a Space Harrier) going off to save "Fantasy Land". This combined with the many flashing gaudy colors the game throws at you leads me to believe that it was born out of a bad acid trip.<br><br>There are 13 stages to complete by jetting around and blasting bad guys and bosses as they approach. The game is played from behind the main character and the landscape rushes up in 3D similar to the effect used in many car games such as Outrun.<br><br>The game uses many of the enemies and bosses from the first Space Harrier, but adds an array of new ones as well.

Space flight takes place in two different modes: Cruise Flight, which is ideal for travelling quickly, and Newtonian Flight, which works best for combat and precision flying. Each planetary system has a variety of destinations and obstacles to travel through via a top-down navigational map. <br><br>Interstellar travel, between systems, is done by finding a Malir Gate and using it to reach hyperspace. While in hyperspace, the game becomes a simple 'tunnel' game where you must manually control the ship not to hit any of the walls. Also hyperspace travel eats away at your ship, so the faster you can get through them, the more armor your ship retains. Finally, when docked on most locations, the game shows your pilot from a top-view and you can walk to different shops/bars/characters.

Description=Cho is a young farmer who travels the world in search of adventure, fame, and fortune. He is asked by the king to find out the whereabouts of the evil prince Gallus, overpower him, and bring him back to the king to serve his punishment for burning down the palace and murdering Kane the previous day. If Cho succeeds in his quest, the king will hand the throne over to him. Unfortunately, Cho doesn't have anything to start off with, so he must find some weapons and protection before he starts.<br><br>Your quest begins in Sharma City, where the palace resides. You can talk to people to get some hints on what to do and where to go. Along the way you may find some weapons that can be found hidden in treasure cheats or are given to Cho. Some of these weapons include swords for killing enemies, and bombs for blowing up obstacles that get in your way. Some locations have teleports (one-way only) that will get you from one place to another, and you can reveal any hidden items by shooting any flora.

Description=Solomon's Key is a clear conceptual influence for this action puzzler. Our hero must guide a ball through a level to the spot marked 'In', by creating and removing blocks to alter its path. The game is prevented from being a pure clone due to the ball, which moves automatically once activated, and can be controlled by using strategically-placed blocks.<br><br>Simply reaching the ball usually involves modifying the level layout using these bricks. There are enemies moving on fixed paths which must be avoided, and bonus items to collect. Also watch for bonuses such as invincibility, gravity-alteration and teleporting. You take time to rotate, so the controls aren't truly immediate. The ball takes 20 seconds to start moving, so use this time to plan ahead.

Description=Spherical Worlds is a multi-directional shoot 'em up in the vein of Alien Breed where players control a small spherical droid which needs to destroy enemy robots on a space station. Each level is won by navigating the maze correctly and reaching the exit, sometimes requiring keys that need to be collected.<br><br>The droid has both a set amount of extra lives and a health bar, which is reduced by touching other robots. There is one main weapon (which can overheat) and a secondary weapon with limited ammo. At the end of each level, weapon upgrades can be bought in a shop.<br><br>The most important aspect of gameplay is that the droid can easily fall off edges or through holes. Different terrains have effects on the acceleration and friction of the droid, so the player has to carefully navigate the levels.

Description=In Spidertronic the player gets to take control of a robotic spider moving through a world of isometric levels. Each level consists of tiles that make out the spider's web. Problem is that the web is under siege by odd spherical creatures. This has lead to some passageways being broken and now it's up to our little spider to repair the damage done. The aim then is to rebuild these parts of each level so that the spider can move on to the next. This is done with the use of coloured tiles. The HUD shows a flashing dot that indicates what colour is needed. The spider then has to find a tile in that colour and move it to the tile that needs to be repaired. Once this is all done the spider gets access to a teleporter and can move on to the next level. The spider isn't alone however. It has to be careful not to come into contact with the balls that move around the web. Balls can be destroyed by building a web in front of them. They won't be gone for long though since they will respawn after just a few seconds.

Spike must rescue his friends from the mysterious castle, but first he has to escape from the (apparently friendly) villager's house where he finds himself, as the door won't open.<br><br>The game is a mix of puzzles and action.

The game is broken into a number of episodes, which carry the overall plot of trying to restore Arthur's kingdom to some semblance of what it once was. Early episodes involve gathering the Knights of the Round Table, who have broken their fellowship. Because of their general distrust and dislike of certain other members, many knights will only return if asked by certain people and/or are given the correct incentive. Ultimately, you will wage a war on the sons of Mordred, who vie for the same throne their father did and stop the machinations of Morgan LeFay<br><br>The game is played on two different levels. The first is a real time map where groups move about from place to place. At any time (or when a group encounters another or a place of importance) you can switch to a 'scene' level, which is a side-view of the group currently highlighted. Here you can pick up, drop, and manipulate quest items.

Description=Star Command is a quite unknown sci-fi role-playing game by SSI, designed by Phantasie designer Winston Douglas Wood. It features a huge universe to be discovered, detailed character generation and development, a mass of items, some exotic aliens and tactical space and squad-level combat, similar to SSI's Pool of Radiance released the same year and other games of the Gold Box series. The game has nothing to do with Star Command Deluxe or Star Command: Revolution.<br><br>The game plays in a distant future. Earth is a distant memory, having been destroyed long ago. The small human population is concentrated in a small portion of the galaxy, called "The Triangle" due to its form, and threatened from its neighbors: The Alpha border is plagued by pirates, recently united under a certain "Blackbeard", the Beta border is frequently ambushed by an intelligent insect-like alien race who is thought to plan an all-out war. The third border leads to largely unknown territory with space-faring robots of unclear origin. The only hope for mankind is the Star Command, the headquarter of military forces. You control a spaceship crew, trying to secure peace by completing missions issued by Star Command.<br><br>Game starts at Startport Luna, where you first will have to assemble and equip your crew and buy a starship before rushing out saving humanity.<br><br>Assembling the crew, i.e. character generation, is quite detailed and done by first recruiting and then training characters. Each character has seven basic stats like Strength and Intelligence. If the stats look okay, you select one of four classes (Pilots for flying ships and communicating with aliens, Marines for espionage, Soldiers for fighting, and finally Espers with strange psi powers). The character now has to be trained for eight years; each year, you select a skill to be trained, and, if you're lucky, the character increases his skill -- he may also learn nothing. Skills can be trained more than once, increasing the effective skill level. All in all, there are 18 skills, with a different set available for each class. Some trainings does not improve skills, but basic stats -- Special Forces, for example, increases speed and accuracy.<br><br>Character usually start out as Privates, but they the rank can be increased by going to Officer's school. There are 13 ranks up to Grand Admiral, with increasing pay -- money is sparse, so this may be a good choice. Then again, it may be not. Later in the game, with enough funds, you can create clones of your character to replace him when he dies. Character also age during play.<br><br>After you have created your crew, it's time to spend your money. First of all, you need a spaceship -- there are nine different ships, with different attributes like armor or fuel capacity. The ship may be upgraded by several systems, including from engines, guns, shields, drop ships, computers, etc. Finally, you have to equip your crew, again choosing among a vast selection of armor, weapons and miscellaneous items. Having a fully equipped crew at your disposal, you're now ready to get some mission from the Space Command and launch your ship!<br><br>While in space, you are shown a view of the environment, with commands at the bottom and the crew or ship status on the right. The galaxy is quite big, consisting of 32x32 sectors, each containing several systems, with each one having up to 10 planets. You can select the view, changing from Galaxy Scan (showing the whole galaxy) to Long Range Scan (showing 8x8 sectors) to Sector Scan (all systems and starports of a sector) to System Scan (the star and its planets) to Visual Scan (direct view of a planet, starport or space station with its statistics).<br><br>While travelling through space, you may encounter ships. The game then switches to turn-based tactical combat -- but that may include peaceful interaction. In each turn, you first have a selection of communication strategies -- bargain, plead, ask, demand, even impersonate a deity are possible. Then you can move and rotate your ship, and finally, you can fire.<br><br>Some situations, for example when you're boarding an enemy ship or while travelling on land, you can engage in squad combat, which closely resembles spaceship combat, but is influenced gravity, atmosphere and terrain.<br><br>One some missions, you will have to explore underground complexes, which may contains traps and other specials events.<br><br>There are 17 missions all in all, but they have no time limit, so you can do other things -- and you should, like trying to get some cash. Additionally, some missions are randomly generated, so each game differs somewhat. Character get training after each completed mission, but they can also pay for it, which is very expensive.<br><br>All in all, the game play is simple to learn, but quite complex and addictive despite the crude graphics and nearly non-existent sound, as the game emphasizes on character development and atmosphere.

As usual, there is the urgent need for energy to power this advanced civilization; one of the primary sources of that energy is quantum black holes.<br><br>In STARCROSS, you are a miner of black holes, scouring the asteroid belt in your one-man survey ship. Finding and harnessing a single black hole can make a person's fortune. It's a lonely business, fraught with the known and unknown hazards of space. You've equipped your ship, the M.C.S. STARCROSS, with the best gear you could afford. You've put everything into this venture, and though you've tried before, you somehow sense that this time will be different.<br><br>The ship's computer handles the functions of navigation and routine maintenance. You watch the sophisticated mass detector as it unceasingly scans the vicinity for uncharted masses. To assuage the tedium of your long trip, you browse through the compact tape library, a compendium of human knowledge and culture. But the drone of the ship gradually lulls you into a deep sleep.<br><br>As you sleep, you dream of the riches which would be yours if your search for a quantum black hole is successful. Little do you suspect that the alarm on your mass detector is about to jolt you out of your dream - but not to grapple with the long-sought black hole. Your quest has taken an unexpected turn, for you are destined to rendezvous with a gargantuan alien spaceship from the outer fringes of the galaxy.

Description=Stardust is basically Asteroids, but with a lot of gameplay modifications. There are 30 standard levels split into 5 worlds. The 6 levels a world is made of can be completed in any order. However, you must fight an end-of-level bad guy once you have finished the 6th level of a world. While each level has the standard disintegrating rocks to destroy, all but 2 of them have extra bad guys, with a range of attack patterns.<br><br>There are a number of different weapons available, which are collected by moving your ship so that it crosses their paths as they float through space. Each of these can be powered up - some weapons start strong but can't be powered up as much as others; fortunately you can power up one weapon while using another. Extra lives, shield enhancements and a smart bomb are also on offer. <br><br>Along with the standard levels, there are also 4 tunnel levels, which involve shooting what you can and dodging everything else as you dart through a ray-traced 3D tunnel, and 2 optional Thrust-style bonus levels in which lives can be won or lost.

Description=In Star Fleet I: The War Begins, you are a cadet fresh out of Starfleet Academy and have assigned to command your first U.G.A.S. Starship! The Federation is currently at war with Krellans and Zaldrons, so choose your first ship from the Federation starport and prepare for your first mission!<br><br>The graphics of the PC version of Star Fleet I: The War Begins are represented by ASCII characters. Everything from your starship, the mainframe to torpedoes are all ASCII characters. <br><br>Gameplay<br>Gameplay consists of fulfilling the target number enemy kills mentioned in the mission briefing in a specified amount of time. Higher levels demands more kills and less time requirements. Gameplay consists of 2 major areas:<br><br>1. Main Computer and Navigation<br>Your starship is equipped with state of the art navigation equipment. The main screen displays your main visual display, consisting of the main star chart map, your current position and visual displays. Other sections/information of the starship maybe accessed through the appropriate buttons.<br><br>Navigation may be conducted automatically or manually. Standard navigation (automatically) is conducted by accessing the main computer and setting out a course. Higher levels may result on random events during navigation (such as electrical storms, running into asteroids or enemy ships). <br><br>Each map is randomly generated and also uncharted. Each quadrant is represented by numbers, where each number refers to: Stars, Starbases and number of enemy ships. Your starship is also equipped with long-ranged sensors to view adjacent quadrants an well as short-ranged sensors to view your current surroundings. For even further exploration, your starship also has probes to scan far-away quadrants. <br><br>Combat: Starships, Starbases, and Marines<br>Combat is the essence of gameplay in Star Fleet I: The War Begins. Entities in a combat situation may consist of the following: Your starship, enemy Krellan starships (max 5 per quadrant), enemy cloaked Zaldron starships (usually one per quadrant), allied Starbase  and Space Marines.<br><br>Combat initiates when your starship enters a hostile quadrant (portrayed by a red number on the main map), usually patrolled by a minimum of 1 (one) Krellan starship. Red Alert is automatically set (unless configured otherwise) resulting the rising of shields and direct attack by enemy starships. <br><br>Enemy starships are either Krellan starships or the Zaldron cloaked. Krellan starships fire only phasors to soften up your shields. Although your starship is greatly over-matched compared to a single Krellan starship, numerous enemy ships will prove very dangerous. Zaldron starships are unique as they have the ability to cloak (invisible on the both map screens). Zaldrons also use phasers as their main weapon.<br><br>This type of combat consists of either eliminating all hostiles in the present quadrant (by destroying the enemy ships) or by capturing those ships (and optionally delivering them to a starbase). Your main arsenal consist of Phaser, Torpedoes and Mines. Torpedoes are reserved for direct destruction of enemy vessels. Phasers are usually reserved for the intent of disabling an enemy vessel for capturing purposes. Mines are used to damage enemy vessels that have the bad habit of moving around when eluding your torpedoes.<br><br>Capturing enemy vessels may only be conducted when the enemy vessel is disabled (by phasers or other means). Space Marines then must board the adjacent ship and automatic combat occurs between your space marines and the enemy crew. If successful, the enemy ship will be captured as well as some power reserves and enemy prisoners. Be warned that enemy prisoners or enemy spies may board your ship without your knowing and damage your ships systems (indicated by "Intruder Alert"). The enemy ship may then be towed to be transported to a Starbase.<br><br>If enemies prove to much for you and your heavily damaged ship, you can opt for "Self-Destruction". Be warned, you will survive but it may hamper your mission score greatly.<br><br>Unique combat situations refer to "Starbase Under Attack" where an allied Starbase is under attack by enemy starships, requiring your immediate attention for rescue.<br><br>After successfully completing a mission, your mission success is rated: Number of enemies destroyed, captured, starbases rescued, etc. You will then be considered for a promotion or a commendation for a medal!

Description=A long time ago, a great empire comprised of Humans, Velox, Thrynn and Elowan ruled the stars. The Empire's currency was an energy source called Endurium. But something happened and this empire is no more. Furthermore, the small colony world named Arth has forgotten this heritage and technology. 1000 years have since passed and the people of Arth have rediscovered archaeological evidence of their empire. Using these discoveries, they create spaceships and form the Interstel corporation to govern the fleet. It's time to take the first steps back into space... but could it be the same enemy that destroyed the Empire still exists?<br><br>Starflight is a space exploration game. The player must first form a crew, assign their positions and customize the spaceship before blasting off from spacedock. Once out into space, the standard interface allows access to different crew members and navigation. The entire galaxy is unknown and it's up to the player to travel to distant planets to explore and land on them. Using a top-down interface, a planetary lander will venture out with the task of  finding minerals and biological data to transport back to Starport. These resources can then be used to train crew members and improve the ship. Different alien races control the galaxy and it will be up to the player to engage them diplomatically or engage them in combat. Successful exploration of the galaxy and alien cultures will yield clues and new leads as to the fate of the Empire.

Description=Space... the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its 5-year mission: To seek out new life and new civilizations, to explore brave new worlds, to boldly go where no one has gone before. Based on the 1960s Star Trek TV Series, Captain Kirk and the USS Enterprise are representatives of the United Federation of Planets. Their role in space is that of explorers as well as a military presence. The Enterprise routinely encounters strange adventures and bizarre situations, each laid out as a separate "episode" which must be played in order. The first episode involves the USS Enterprise being called to a world to investigate strange "demons" have appeared from the mines and begun attacking the settlers.<br><br>Star Trek: 25th Anniversary is a combination of a point-and-click, side-scrolling adventure game and a first person starship simulator. This tie-in actually missed the 25th Anniversary of Star Trek's TV debut by half a year (nearly 3 years in the case of the Amiga version), but it uses the original series' characters and settings. Players directly control Captain Kirk, leader of the Starship Enterprise, and are able to give orders to other crewmembers. While the enterprise is on a peaceful mission, combat is possible. A new game begins on the bridge of the Enterprise, seen from a 3rd person view of Kirk, but a first person view out the viewscreen of the Enterprise. When on board the ship, Kirk can contact Chekov to assign a designation, raise shields or begin combat, contact Sulu to engage warp or adjust magnification, contact Spock to scan for data and search for keyword information, contact Uhura to deal with communications, and contact Scotty to change power allocation and repair damage and beam down to a planet.  During combat, the player steers the Enterprise manually and is able to turn in 720 degrees of direction as well as increase or decrease speeds. Weaponry includes phaser banks which draw from the ship's energy and proton torpedoes which are in limited supply.<br><br>The adventuring bulk of the game comes in the form of many landing party missions, in which the player beams down to the surface of a planet and explores the situation. Kirk can move about on the screen, other crew members automatically follow him. From the menu, he chooses a body part to perform an action: eyes represent looking, mouth represents speaking, one hand represents using items (and crewmembers) while another is to pick up objects. Kirk carries an inventory of items collected which can be accessed and used at any time. In most missions Kirk will carry a communicator to contact the ship and a phaser weapon which can be set to "stun" or "kill",  The point-and-click adventure has different solutions to problems, but the ideal goal of the federation is to solve things non-violently. Performance is rated accordingly as well as being based on how many extra discoveries and advances made and interaction with different beings, including aliens. The surroundings are all based on styles from the TV series and solutions to puzzles involve the skills of multiple crew members.

Interstellar travel was nonexistent, and many star systems descended into a near-barbaric state, buring coal and gas for energy, and growing food directly from exposed topsoil. In 11,203 GY, a treaty between the Empires of Tremain and Galium formed the Third Galactic Union. Ships of the Stellar Patrol (a pseudo-military wing of the Union government on Tremain) began exploring the galaxy, searching for the human civilizations that are the remnants of the Second Galactic Union. You are a native of the planet Gallium, one of the most politically powerful but culturally barren worlds in the Union. Your great-great-grandfather was a founding officer of the Stellar Patrol, and for five generations, your family has served in the Patrol. It was always taken for granted that you would sign up as soon as you came of age. Once in the Patrol, you discovered that the exciting career promised in all the Patrol recruitment brochures was nonsense. Your life was drudgery and demerits. The one time you got to see an exotic planet was right after a big parade, when they needed a detail to sweep up all the confetti. Then came your big moment: shipwrecked on a seemingly deserted world, you met an exuberant robotic companion named Floyd. Together, the two of you discovered the secret of that mysterious planet, Resida, and saved it from near destruction.

Description=Seemingly, even with Tetris over 5 years old by the time this game was made, there were new things to do with blocks that had to be dropped from the top of screen by being correctly position, and grouped into lines of 3 (horizontally, vertically or diagonally), so that those blocks would disappear and cause others to drop to fill the gaps. In Statix you have to balance the blocks on a see-saw, which has a central pivot which starts several notches above the ground. <br><br>The balance adjusts depending on how many blocks are in each column, meaning that removing vertical matches from the far end of the playing area has an especially dramatic effect. If it is too unbalanced, it's game over. Things are also made harder by the limited amount of blocks that can be supported - if this is exceeded the see-saw drops a notch, giving you less leeway with the even-ness of the blocks.<br><br>There's a two player mode in which each player has access to half of the see-saw, and the player whose end becomes overstocked loses. At times co-operation is required to keep the game alive, at other times you ought to set up a combo on your side, causing it to plummet down on your opponent.

Description=In a run-down world, plagued by criminality and bad social conditions, a notorious gangster boss is on the run. A gang of fearless fighters with a strong sense of justice are out to put an end to his regime, though. They must fight their way through the eight levels of the squalid town and the hordes of mafia henchmen. Their path is long and bloody.<br><br>The Strangers is a side-scrolling beat'em'up, firmly planted in the Double Dragon tradition. You will recognise the rather small sprites and the fierce fist-fighting. Apart from jumps, kicks and punches, weapons such as knives, chains, hockey clubs and barrels can be used to make the procedure short with the enemy, which attacks in large gangs. Another typical trait of the genre is that the enemies try to grab your character so that another one can beat you senseless. This drains your life juices, which can be replenished by picking up soft drinks. Picking up a pair of shoes makes you jump higher, and first aid kits grant you an extra credit. <br><br>If you run out of life juices, you are left standing at the mercy of the enemy, who will happily take your life in Mortal Kombat-inspired, very graphic "fatalities". These fatalities can be turned off for the less sadistically inclined players.<br><br>Several modes of play are available:<br><br>1. Action game: For one or two players, played as Double Dragon. In one-player mode, two fighters are controlled simultaneously.<br>Death match: For up to six simultaneous players against each other in an arena. Last man standing wins. 24 different characters are available.<br>Gang war: As above, but split on several gangs. Energy meters are turned off, instead you fight for points. Hitting comerades impacts negatively on your score.<br>Training: Learn the moves of your fighter against two holographic opponents.<br><br>Technically, the game uses hand-drawn sprites against mostly 3D rendered backgrounds. Since the game is delivered on CD, it also features a long 3D rendered intro with a sampled narrator.

Description=Based on the 1989 Atari Games (not to be confused with Atari Corporation, producers of the Lynx) coin-op by Ed Rotberg.  It's 2492 and you must pilot your Sub-Terranean Underground Network (S.T.U.N.) craft at speeds over 900 miles per hour through a series of courses to retain your title as S.T.U.N. Runner, completing each course before time runs out.<br><br>There are also enemies on each course, such as cycles, indestructible armored drones, and flying bird-like craft.  Shoot or avoid them.  If you hit them, you lose one of your shields (your craft has six total) and are slowed down temporarily.  The more shields you have at the finish line, the more bonus points you get.  Getting hit with no shields does not kill you, however.  There are no lives in this game.  The only way to lose is to fail to cross the finish line.<br><br>Along the way you'll encounter Boost Pads that temporarily speed you up to incredible speeds and make you indestructible.  By running over enough green stars on each course, you can also earn Shockwaves, which destroy all enemies in your path.<br><br>Note that there is no accelerator in this game.  Your craft always goes full speed, unless you hit something.  Then you will slow down, but quickly accelerate back to full speed.  Other than that, you cannot slow down and the only way to speed up is to run over a Boost Pad.  Your only controls are steering left and right and aiming the gun on top of your craft up and down.

Description=Subbuteo recreates the famous table football game, which makes for something very different from Sensible/Kick Off/FIFA style games. It's effectively a turn-based strategy game of sorts, as each player has 30 seconds to make their move (within a 30 minute match length), which involves first selecting a player, then aiming the direction in which he will be flicked, then the power and swerve of the flick are determined by the length of time the button is held down for. <br><br>With any luck, your player will hit the ball, and hit it such that it doesn't leave the playing area, and doesn't hit an opponent. If any of those rules are violated, possession passes to the opposition. Before each flick, the team not in possession can make a 'defensive flick' involving moving one of their players into a potential blocking position (without hitting the ball or an opponent, as this is a foul).

If you know Hogan only from his movies, you'll have a different reason for crying. One of the films featuring Hulk was called Suburban Commando (1991). Alternative Software turned it into a game two years later, and decided to create a wild mix of space shooter, platform jumping and - of course - beat-em-up action.<br><br>Loosely following the storyline of the film, Hogan alias intergalactic hero Shep Ramsey travels through space, crash-lands on earth and beats up the bad guys. The first level is a R-Type-like horizontal space shooter; destroy formations of drones and collect weapon upgrades. After that, you'll enter three platform levels, in which you have to find nine items each. Avoid being shot and dispatch the enemies with kicks and jumps. After each mission, you’ll encounter the level boss, who you’re supposed to beat up in a Street Fighter clone.<br><br>Apart from a comic-style likeness of Hulk Hogan as the main hero (with a huge head and tiny body -- strange), the game has little reference to the movie. No other main characters appear. Fans of the film will especially mourn the complete absence of any mimics.

This absorbs them, and allows them to be fired out against a wall; if they don’t reach the wall, they live to fight another day. You must destroy them all within a specific time limit to progress.

Description=Super Monaco GP is a modified conversion of the arcade game, a first-person perspective racing game. As well as the famous Monaco course, others from around the world have been added, to give the game a longer shelf life. You must complete qualification sessions and the races as fast as possible.<br><br>The Genesis version of Super Monaco adds a complete career mode, however.  In the career mode, your goal is to win a season of races. Unfortunately, you start with a relatively slow car.  By challenging other drivers, you can move to a better team and car, and ultimately win the F1 World Title.

There are several different weapons available, which you don’t lose when you die.<br><br>There are numerous different control options – the standard one involves always firing in the direction you’re aiming, but others include one where your firing direction can be changed by flicking the joystick with fire held down, an option where you move using the main 4 directions and use the bottom-left and bottom-right diagonal to rotate the firing direction, and an option where you use one joystick for direction of movement, and the other for direction of fire.

You control Mr. Do, a clown, and guide him trough a field with varying elevation levels, with balls placed on it. You must collect those balls to replenish your weapon, a ball that you throw at your enemies. A trail (shown as a line) follows you while moving around. The area you moved turns gray and will be uncovered. All the balls in that gray area turn into cherries. And, if you do the same with the cherries, they will be upgraded to oranges. The oranges can be upgraded to lemons and finally the lemons upgraded to pineapples. Hidden under the field is a letter (in the shape of a coin), which can be used for the "EXTRA" at the top of the screen. When any of the letters that spell the word "EXTRA" are collected an army of enemies that follows you show up and one of those enemies holds the letter that you touched.<br>To obtain the letter you must kill that enemy. Now you can collect the other letters. When you obtained all the letters that spell the word "EXTRA" you will receive a bonus.<br>On the field are logs, which can be unleashed by walking next to the side that is propped up. The log rolls down and kills all enemies it rolls over. But be careful! It can kill you too! To continue to the next round, you can kill all enemies or collect all the balls or fruits.

You could link 2 Amiga 1200s (or faster) and use them to display the track across 2 separate screens. There were two novelty options of sorts as well - motorized cows, and the chance to have the cars pulling caravans as you race - using the caravan to push an opponent off-line was a skill worth mastering. <br><br>24 circuits are provided, all of them with walls around them to ensure crash-bang-wallop racing, and most of them have parts which cross with other parts, making collisions possible if you're much ahead of (or behind) other cars (fortunately there's no car damage). They can be raced forwards or backwards - perhaps the first game with this feature available. You could either run single races, or one of the in-built championships - one for each car, across a specially selected set of tracks.<br><br>The customizable nature of the game goes even further - the number of laps can be set, as can the colour and power of the cars. As you repeatedly race a track, the markings on the course are eroded by the cars running over them.

There are three stages to taking a shot. Move the player up and down to line up his run-up, pressing fire to set the position. Then, do the same to set the angle of the shot. Finally, after pressing fire to start the run-up, press it again to time the release of the ball, as close to the line as possible.<br><br>Darts has 4 skill and 3 speed levels, and players can play to 301, 501 or 701, to vary game length or provide a handicapping system. You can also set whether scoring must start or end with a double. Viewed from behind the board, you must first line up the dart, then set the dart's curvature and power by stopping a curved gauge on the right, then a rising power bar on the left. The view then changes twice - first a behind-the-player view to show the dart's approach, then a close-up of the board to show where it landed.<br><br>Air Hockey plays for five minutes, or until someone has scored 12 points. The view is above the pitch but angled so as to emphasize the goal at the top.<br><br>Ping-Pong features a handicapping system - six ability areas can be graded from 1-5, to ensure a closely-matched game. Again the view is from behind one court. To impart direction onto a shot, the angle must be pressed at the same time as the fire button.

Now is the time to avenge your father and keep well the title Duke of Allada. Recruit an army and prepare for the upcoming onslaught! The future and fate of Allada and its role in Aragon now rests in your hands!<br><br>Sword of Aragon is a turned-based fantasy strategy game where you rule a small town called Allada in the North Western part of the land known as Aragon. Most of the political map is yet undiscovered and you have to maintain a strong economy and military force to venture forth. The storyline revolves around your duties as the Duke of Allada, exploring the uncharted areas of Aragon and uncovering its mysteries, conquering neighboring cities, as well as the political intrigues surrounding the city-states of Aragon.   <br><br>In Sword of Aragon, you can choose one of the 5 different character classes for your leading hero, each with different bonuses to your troops and abilities: Warrior, Knight, Ranger, Priest, or Mage. Different selection of character class does not affect the storyline.<br><br>Gameplay<br>Gameplay of Sword of Aragon consists of 3 major categories:<br><br>1. City and Resource Development and Management<br>With Allada as the first city you control (though later in the game you may acquire many other cities in the land of Aragon), the first rule of business is developing your town and creating a steady economy. Military development and maintenance costs money and unless those Orcs come again with more friends, you had better maintain a decent military garrison. The only way to get money is to tax the revenues of your city. These revenues come from 5 different sectors: Farming, Lumber, Mining, Commerce, and Manufacturing. The stronger the sector, the higher your tax income. You can do this by investing money to selected sectors which strengthens your economy (and your city happiness) as well as promoting more people to come to your city and well as a steady stable birthrate (more people means more taxes!)<br><br>Besides developing resources, you can also invest in structures and fortifications. Aragon is fantasy world filled with mystery and monsters, a town without walls is inviting inevitable disaster from marauding enemies. Structures and fortification investment guarantee thick walls and battlements for your troops to defend themselves in the event of an attack. Structures also have an additional use of storing surplus food for those harsh winter days.<br><br>You can also recruit military units and heroes at cities. Military units and heroes may only be recruited providing you have the money as well as available recruits at the selected city. Recruits increase through time although you may also conscript citizens, however it will have a negative effect to your city happiness.<br><br>Military Development and Combat<br><br>You start the game preparing for combat. Thus, recruiting an army is the first priority in the game. There are different types of military units as wells as heroes that you can recruit: Infantry, Cavalry, Bowmen, and Mounted Bowmen. The more experience your troops obtain (either from training or combat) the stronger they become as well as able to equip more various selections of armor and weapons. Heroes can be recruited to up to 20 units (yourself included). Heroes, though weak at the beginning of the game, provide backup combat bonuses for your troops (especially Warrior, Knights and Rangers) as well as devastating offense magic and beneficial support magic (Rangers, Priests and Mages).<br><br>The combat screen generally consists of the combat terrain and military units: Your hero and your main forces, the opponents’ main forces, as well as the allies of either side (when applicable). There is no time limit on combat - it ends when either side is annihilated or withdraws from battle.<br><br>Exploring and Random Events<br>At the start of the game, you can view Allada and its surroundings, particularly the Northern areas. The Southern and Eastern maps remain unexplored by your map makers. Exploring will uncover set and random events which will progress the overall story.

Description=Talespin is an adventure game creation system made by Mark Heaton and his family (wife and their five children), which allows you to create interactive graphic- and text-oriented adventure games, demos, books, tutorials, or whatever application you can think of. It offers graphics, 100 development commands, mouse control, no copy protection, hard drive support, and Telltale, a run-only module that allows users without Talespin to see your work.<br><br>Talespin also includes two sample adventure games: The Grail made by 19-year-old Rudyard Heaton and The Wolf made by another artist<br><br>The design idea that drives Talespin is a "page" built from drawings, text, and sound. Conditions and variables control the text, graphic, and action/solution possibilities, and all pages are linked to form a complete story sequence. The Chain To Title At Page option lets you connect one story to another, linking new or continuing tales across more than one disk.<br><br>The paint/drawing program offers Pencil, Spray, Mini-Spray, Block, Blob, Line, and Fill functions. The Lens option allows magnification of a screen area for detailed work; Undo removes the most recent drawing action. Although Talesplin can handle 512 colors, the ST can display only 16 at a time (due to a hardware limitation); therefore, all drawings on a page must use the same palette. Pictures can be copied from other stories as well as sounds.<br><br>Variables let you control the flow of text entries and drawings. Variables must be defined (CONVERSATION, for example), set to a level, and given conditions that will determine further text actions or movement to different pages. The proper setting of variables, their values, and their conditions provides for more than one action or solution for a given puzzle or problem.<br><br>All the menu selections are controlled with the mouse: the pointer highlights, the left button selects. Clicking the right button brings up the dvelopment menu. The only oddity about Talespin concerns text. Clicking a character's head brings up a bubble, within which will appear the currently available choices. The mouse pointer is used to highlight either question; the left button selects it; the program will then take the appropriate action.

Description=Team Suzuki uses official support to simulate motorcycle racing using polygon graphics. The action is viewed from the cockpit. Contact with other bikes or the scenery gradually increases the damage percentage, which will eliminate you at 100%. Crashing results in an external replay of your final moments.<br><br>Joystick and mouse control options exist, with the mouse being ultimately faster but harder to learn. 125, 250 and 500cc options exist, with the difficulty higher on the more powerful bikes. You can contest a full season, single race, or simply practice on a free track. <br><br>16 circuits are featured, from Suzuka and Misano to Rijeka and Philip Island, with races over 5-50 laps. Your opponents are seven factory Suzuki riders from various classes at the time, including 1993 500cc World Champion Kevin Schwantz.

Description=In this tank simulation game based on Harold Coyle's New York Times N° 1 Bestseller of the same name, Team Yankee is a squad of crack tank drivers and gunners. They are in the latest tanks, such as the well known Abrams M1, Bradley M2, T-72 and T-62, armed with lasers, machine guns and SABOTs . As Commander Sean Bannon, you must use these resources correctly in five missions ranging from defending a hill to attacking a centre through a forest.<br><br>The control interface of the game is somewhat unique as it features a four-way split screen with different control options in order to grant direct orders to four individual platoons of tanks. The game simulates  instruments of war including thermal imaging in a very detailed manner, as well as giving access to scrolling maps of the battlefield as combat unfolds.

Description=You control Thomas, a strange-looking but vaguely cutesy animal of some description in an ultra-fast platform game. There are 50 levels, split into 5 groups of 10.<br><br>Each one has a certain number of gems, and your task is to collect a certain number of them (for example, level 2 has 55 and you need at least 40) and then find the exit, all within the time limits. The yellow gems are worth 50 points and the purple ones 100, although the purple ones don’t appear to be more precariously-placed, and the total makes no distinction, so this is for colour as much as anything. Once you’ve got the required amount, the gems double in value, tempting you to continue to explore<br><br>The levels are infested with cutesy-looking baddies, such as birds and bears, which can’t be killed, and must be avoided, as contact with them costs you time as Thomas picks himself up. You can jump on the heads of some of them, which gives a small points bonuses. The layouts include ropes to ascend, moving platforms and more. Some levels are entirely vertically-scrolling, seeing you progress up the ledges of a tree or similar.<br><br>If you run out of time you lose a life, but the level isn’t reset, so you keep the number of gems collected and have a fresh set of time. This means that you are far less likely to lose a second life on the level, similarly to Chase HQ.

Play as Leonardo, Michaelangelo, Donatello and Raphael (one turtle only, but the ability to swap between turtles at any time) as you save your friends and battle The Shredder and his cronies.

In addition to each turtle's main weapon, sub-weapons (such as shuriken) can be acquired, to use at foes - these have a limited use.

For the Germans, there is the fighter Bf 109, the heavy fighter/fighter bomber Bf 110, the infamous Ju 87 Stuka dive bomber, and the three light/medium bombers Do 17, He 111 and Ju 88.<br><br>Next to training missions for every plane, there are several historical combat missions to be flown. In accordance with history, most RAF missions consist of defense assignments - intercepting and destroying German bombers. Most Luftwaffe missions are attack runs - either flying the bomber escort or the bombers themselves. In the heavier planes, not only can the pilot of the plane be controlled, but also the gunner(s), and, in the bombers, the bombardier.<br><br>The special Campaign Mode allows one to actually change the historical outcome of the Battle of Britain. On a strategic map, planes must be organized into groups and assigned to missions, one of which must be flown.

Description=Time Bandit is a Gauntlet-style arcade game with text adventure elements.<br><br>Having nothing to do with the Terry Gilliam movie Time Bandits, this game utilises the time-travel theme for a fast-paced variation on the good old Gauntlet concept. Your bandit visits 16 different worlds throughout time to grab as much loot as possible and, in the long run, do some universe-saving stuff as well.<br><br>Each of the 16 locations -- featuring such varied places like a medieval arena, a bomb factory, a wrecked spaceship and a ghost town -- is basically a labyrinth filled with treasure and -- you guessed it -- monsters. You've got to dodge these or blast them with your weapon, while collecting keys, opening doors and searching for the exit. Although theoretically each location consists of 16 sub-levels, these are merely the basic layout flipped or mirrored, some items redistributed and the monster speed increased. After completing a level, you return to the world map, where you may freely choose the next challenge (nice) and save your game (very nice).<br><br>Interestingly, Time Bandit tries to spice up the fast arcade action with text adventure scenes. Due to this strange mixture, you will occasionally bump into persons or computer consoles with which interaction is possible. For example, you've got to explore and repair the damaged spaceship Excalibur. However, the parser is crude at best; you'll have to know exactly what to do, or else you will trigger no reaction. <br><br>Gaming veterans will discover a score of elements of and allusions to arcade classics, such as Gauntlet (obviously), Pac-Man, Centipede, Bomberman, and others.

The player controls the soldiers by clicking on them and selecting orders icons from the command window:<br><br>- a fist icon is to attack;<br><br>- an upward arrow to select the route;<br><br>- a wrench to repair things;<br><br>- a shield to stand guard;<br><br>- a target to surround the unit.<br><br>The game has 65 levels spread on a variety of different terrains (garden, kitchen, etc).

Description=Titan is a 2D arcade game / puzzle game hybrid.<br><br>For some reason, mad professors of the future tend to invent strange entertainment games in which every participant dies. Professor Hybrys’ variant is called Titan and involves a ball, a control unit and 80 labyrinths. Your objective is either to destroy all destructible blocks in each level by hitting them with the sphere, or to pilot it to the exit. The black ball is beyond your control; it will bounce straight or diagonally through the labyrinth with constant speed. You move the control unit, a small box, with you are to position in a way that the ball bounces off it in the desired direction. You can also catch the sphere by quickly moving over it, and then release it in a direction of your choice.<br><br>The labyrinths not only contain harmless, destructible blocks, but also increasingly difficult hazards. If the sphere or your control unit hit a skull symbol, one of your nine lives is lost. Teleporters exchange the position of you and the ball, wall pieces can be pushed around or destroyed by your unit, floor tiles will grow into walls when you pass over them too often. The high game speed can be slowed down by holding the space key – a very useful option in tricky situations.<br><br>Titan mixes an arcade game foundation (requiring quick reflexes and good nerves) with puzzle game elements (requiring logical thinking to beat the complex levels). The challenge is to control the sphere accurately, yet indirectly.

As in that game, the aim is to collect objects (by pulling down on the movement controls) to solve puzzles. One main difference from Dizzy is the fact that Blinky carries a gun with infinite ammunition. There's an energy bar at the bottom of the screen that gets depleted every time Blinky touches an enemy. When it's empty, Blinky literally flips over and the player loses one life. The game starts with three lives, and there's no form of saving progress.

You have five frogs, and when all of them has reached safety, you will advance to the next level. In later levels the game will become tougher and not just because of the increased speed. You will come across new dangers to watch out for, such as a locomotive, a lawn mover and a tractor. A difference from the original Frogger is that there is a barrier in the middle of the road, making it a bit harder.

You control a girl in a rave outfit who jumps through a series of platform worlds where you throw some love around in the form of hearts, which somehow ties into an environmentally conscious (the packaging was made out of recycled paper) theme where the enemies are representatives of big business. Also, similar to Rainbow Islands, a mass of water is slowly rising from below, so you must hurry upwards through the level. The graphics make the game look not quite like anything else, as though the graphics artist just inverted all the tiles and put them in a random order.<br><br>Keeping with the 90s sentiment of "information wants to be free", the samples and sprites are kept uncompressed on the disks, for everyone to edit according to their own tastes.

This can be spent on various upgrades, ranging from engine to tires (wet and dry) and from shocks (front, side and rear) to gearboxes.

What was once your only concern, the defense of your planet against the warriors of Craylon, has now changed to an even greater, more difficult challenge.  Fireballs, which are what remains of planets once destroyed during an earlier interplanetary nuclear war, are now bombarding the your planet's surface and destroying its inhabitants. You must now protect the surface of Torch.  Using an old S.D.G. (surface defense glider) designed for defense of the planet against the Craylon race, you must use it to construct metallic panels above the planet surface increasing the structure of the candar shield.  You must attempt to limit the flight area of the incoming fireballs by flying from panel to panel and edge to edge of your territory constructing new panels while avoiding your ships destruction. <br><br>The object of the game is to shield a required percentage of your territory in order to advance to the next level. Receive points for shielding areas of the playfield. By using the joystick you are able to move your glider around the perimeter of the playfield and all those panels which were created, but you cannot travel along the edges shared by panels. A protective panel is created by pressing the joystick button. There is also a limit to the flight time. This can be monitored by checking your fuel gauge on the screen. <br><br>Remain safe by avoiding contact with the fireball and its deadly spitfires, contact with them means death of your glider. Another hazard is perimeter patrollers who trace the edge of new and old panels alike, in a berserk rage. These crystals patrol all of the perimeters of the shield seeking to destroy any and all life, even you. But creating panels can even be a dangerous task. The construction line contains a lot of energy and is very unstable. If your glider stands in any one place while constructing a panel, the energy may become unstable resulting in your demise.

Description=There's a witty double meaning in this title. You much guide a character from the start of a maze through to the end. The difficulty is that each square disappears after your step on it, meaning that you have to touch the square and go, without being able to return.<br><br>You're also up against a strict time limit, so it's all too easy to make a crucial mistake and be forced to step into oblivion. It's therefore definitely touch and go as to whether you can get through it.

The game involves answering questions on one of six subject categories to gain moves, and answering questions on special squares to gain one of the six 'Wedges' you need to gain the right to take on the final winning question. Questions are aimed at British players - many entertainment questions are based on British TV, and sport questions relate to popular British sports.<br><br>Two game modes are available:- single player (which involves answering questions against the clock) and multiplayer (where you can take on up to five human-controlled players). The computer reveals the answer, and you select 'yes' or 'no' to tell it whether you got it right.<br><br>The question categories are exactly the same as the board game, however two different question styles are added to take advantage of computer technology - some questions relate to a picture or diagram and some relate to a piece of music. <br><br>One additional feature not available in the board game is a statistical analysis of the number and type of questions answered correctly. This can be split into the performances of all the players, or the performance of an individual player within the six categories. It is especially useful at the end of the game, when choosing which category a player must answer to win the game.

You play a Troll roaming the levels in the hope of rescuing as many baby trolls as possible - each level gives you a set minimum to retrieve before you can leave via the Pigstop.<br><br>Initially you have no weapons, and contact with the nasties costs you energy, but a Yo-Yo can be collected, which can be used not only to kill enemies, but also to smash blocks away and open up paths, and even (with practice) tied to a ledge to allow you to swing across a gap. <br><br>Throughout the levels you will find the letters B,O,N,U,S and G released from bonus balloons or on killing an enemy - if at the end of a level your letters spell out Bonus or Bogus you go to the appropriate extra level. The former has a chance to gain extra lives, the latter must be escaped quickly to avoid losing a life.

As in Rise of the Robots, you always play the same character in one-player mode, and in a break from tradition he (a definite human, presumably making the game even less appealing to a female audience seeking to identify) is on the right of the screen at the start (although, unlike Rise, you can jump over your opponent- hooray!). <br><br>A limited range of attacking moves are on offer, none of which are beyond the realms of what ordinary humans can do, gives the game a martial-arts feel more akin to the older beat 'em ups, and removes the need for complex control moves. The game has both sound effects and music, although you can't choose between them, or access the options after starting your first fight, short of rebooting.

So he makes the machine and uses it for the transport--for picking the other cave friends up and dropping them to their desired destinations. <br><br>Ugh! is an action game where you must complete 69 levels, riding inside a pedal-powered helicopter to pick up passengers and carry them to their destinations. Each level is made of a series of platforms, with several cave entrances. Cavemen walk out of the caves and loudly announce where they want to go. You have to land your helicopter taxi next to the passenger and wait until he crawls inside (if you land on him, he'll fall into the water at the bottom of the level, although he can still be rescued) and then fly to the cave that he wants to get to. Controlling the vehicle is a bit complicated - you cannot directly fly up or down; instead, you have to keep pedalling to fly up, and cease pedalling when you want to go downwards. Bumping into a wall too hard will cause a game over and force you to restart the level. There is also a time limit for each level. To finish a level, you have to serve a number of customers. <br><br>There are some dinosaur adversaries on certain levels - a pterodactyl which appears unexpectedly and flies across the screen, and a triceratops which becomes agitated when you land near and charges at your taxi. <br><br>As you pedal, you exert energy.

Description=The fourth game in the now well-established Ultima series featured an improved game engine, with color graphics and better character interaction (you could now have actual conversations with NPCs). But what really makes Ultima IV shine is its radical departure from any other RPG made before or since in terms of the story and goal. <br><br>Instead of building up your character by any means possible in order to face the Ultimate Evil in a big bang up showdown, in Ultima IV you were trying to become the Avatar, a role model of sorts for the people of the land. This meant upholding the "eight virtues" and basically trying to become a better person. In most RPGs you chose to be a just/nice hero because the people you'd help would usually provide you with some nice equipment for your services, but in Ultima IV you helped people not for a reward or to advance the plot but simply because it was the "right thing to do". The game actually frowns on behavior that was typical of most other RPGs, such as backstabbing fleeing monsters or picking up everything that wasn't nailed down even if it didn't belong to you. The game keeps track of all your actions, so if you went about killing and looting like in most RPGs, you'd never finish the game.<br><br>This VERY different approach to the game's ultimate goal is what makes Ultima IV famous so many years later, and became the sort of design philosophy that made all the following Ultimas so unique in their genre. <br><br>Of course, the game still has plenty of traditional RPG elements such as dungeons to explore and hostile monsters to kill, as well as a typical final "Holy Grail" type quest where you had to find the Codex of Ultimate Wisdom to complete your transformation into Avatarhood.

With the money earned in these sci-fi contests, improved equipment can  be bought in five categories, making the robot more powerful, more maneuverable and less easy to damage. On the other hand, getting damaged means you must spend money on repairs. This encourages careful and effective playing.<br><br>The game can be played solo, competitively in two-player hot-seat mode or cooperatively in split-screen mode.<br><br>The Amiga and the PC version of the game have the same basic design, but entirely different levels.

In the 501 game the aim is to reduce your score from 501 to 0, finishing with a double or the bull. If your score reaches 1 or a negative number, any shots in that set of 3 are cancelled out. In Round The Board you must hit each target in turn starting with 20, but moving back 2 or 3 for a double or treble, eventually finishing with Double Top.<br><br>Both of these games are recreated in this simulation.

You as the commander (Napoleon or Wellington) must even deal with a time delay in the occurrence in events and the time it takes for those events to be relayed back to HQ and the time it takes to issue orders and see those orders carried out. A text parser is used to issue orders during the game. The battle ends at 9:30 pm at which time full battle reports will become available and the results assessed. You are also given the option to review the battlefield.The game is solitaire only and the playing time is 10-20 hours.

Description=Having previously recreated the more internationally famed rugby union with World Class Rugby, Audiogenic switched their attention to Rugby League, using the same game engine.<br><br>The main differences in the league game is that a team has to give up possession after being tackled six times – which often leads to some bold moves on the 5th tackle, especially as if you retrieve the ball an opposition player, you get a fresh set of six tackles – and that after a tackle, play restarts by flicking the ball back to another player (inexplicably knows as the ‘Play-the-Ball’), while the entire teams (of 13 players, not the 15 in Union) remain on their side of the ball. Instead of line-outs, the ball going out of play at the side results in a scrum, as does a knock-on (fumbling attempts to control a pass or recieve a kick) if those are switched on.<br><br>The gameplay is viewed from either a Kick Off-style overhead view or a forced-perspective 3D one, with a scanner on screen to show where your team-mates are (this is more important than in football). Passing is pulled off by pressing fire and directing the pass, whereas holding down fire will kick the ball up ahead. Tackling involves aiming at the player, and diving if necessary. Set-piece kicks involve aiming the direction and angle by pressing fire at the right times to stop a crosshair.

The controls reflect this, with moving the controller to the right actually moving the character down and right, moving it down and right moving the character down directly, and so on. Each level is played out against a time limit, and the paths through the level aren’t always clear-cut. There are four different types of doors, each of which needs a particular icon to pass (the icons represent the door type, such as ice or bricks, rather than hot water or a key, or anything you’d logically expect to clear the path). You can avoid the baddies, which may be the best option, as killing them costs you some energy –this reduces the significance of the points system.

After a successful bombing run, return to mow down the Japanese soldiers with your machine guns. You also have to sink Japanese battleships with torpedoes and engage in dogfights with enemy fighter planes.<br><br> <br>You start each mission by taking off from an aircraft carrier, which you'll have to protect from assaults by Japanese torpedo planes.

Description=Formula 1 Grand Prix is the first instalment of what would quickly become the Formula 1 simulation series for the PC in the 1990's. Designed and programmed by racing game specialist Geoff Crammond (REVS, Stunt Track Racer), Grand Prix 1 did not only introduce a multitude of features previously unknown to computer racing simulations, but also sported a physics engine that was, at its time, unmatched in its complexity and realism. Grand Prix 1 features:<br><br>1. 3D graphics out of filled, unshaded polygons on PC and Amiga - the PC version has pavement and lawn textures. The sheer number of track-side details (down to billboards and camera cranes) forced any computer below a decent 386 DX to its knees.<br><br>2. Working rear mirrors. Though they show only cars and no scenery, they are invaluable for blocking overtakers.<br><br>3. Collisions with flying debris and actual crude damage models: wings are visibly bent after crashes.<br><br>4. Wet weather that influences traction. No rain graphics, but a fog effect obscures your vision when you drive in another car's splash water.<br><br>5. An extensive tuning part that greatly influences the performance of your car. In-race setup allows you to adjust gear ratios, brake balance, wing downforce and tires during each visit to the box.<br><br>6. Six optional driving aids that help F1 rookies finish their race: toggle best line and suggested gear displays to learn track tactics, or have auto brakes, auto gears, self-righting spins and indestructability improve your driving.<br><br>7. A replay system that lets you watch race scenes from three different views, including track-side cameras.<br><br>Formula 1 Grand Prix includes all 16 international GP circuits of 1991. You may drive them in quick race mode, single race or a full championship. The 18 teams and 35 drivers and their performance are based on the 1991 season, but the game doesn't include real names. You can edit and save team and driver names by hand.<br><br>While the Amiga version allows multiplayer races in hotseat mode, the PC version originally had solo races only.

While the spores approach, you can suck them out of space with a gigantic hoover-like space hose. Once they settle onto the stations hull, jump into the space suit and spray infected areas with a cleansing agent. Undetected spores will seep into the station’s corridors, where you must hunt them down with a plasma shots and avoid being shot in return.<br><br>In addition, up to ten droids are under your (indirect) control. Ranging from cleaners to fighters to engineers, these automatons will act independently, but can be sent to key locations within the station -- i.e. infected areas. As your officer gains experience through battles, he will be promoted to higher ranks, enabling him to construct more efficient fighter robots in the station’s droid factory.<br><br>Since plasmodians running rampant in the station will cause system malfunctions, your main goal is to clear infections quickly and make sure that Beacon continues to function properly. To make things worse, an self-destruct mechanism will explode the station in 60 minutes unless all signs of spore activity cease. <br><br>Effective droid construction and assignment, quick reactions to approaching swarms and good reflexes thus combine into a challenging race against time that makes Wreckers stand out as a clever twist of the “alien invasion” action archetype.

It's even possible that a nation gets so fed up with you that it signs a pact with the aliens and ceases funding altogether. <br><br>Once you join a ground battle, the game switches to Battlescape, which is an isometric view of the battlefield with realistic line-of-sight calculations and turn-based combat. Your mission is usually extermination of all aliens on the battlefield, though if you can capture a few it would surely help your research efforts. If you win, you also recover any alien artifacts left on the field, which can then be researched.<br><br>In combat, each of your soldiers has a specific number of Time Units. Doing anything (moving, shooting, turning around, rearranging objects in the inventory etc.) costs a number of TUs. Once a soldier is out of TUs, he cannot act any more this turn (he gets all his TUs back on the next turn, though). <br><br>The game aims to mix strategic considerations, resource management, and tactical combat considerations, along with plenty of authentic UFO lore.

Description=Xenon is the obscure and mysterious predecessor to the much better known Xenon 2: Megablast. The game is actually nothing like its sequel, with completely different control scheme and gameplay. The plot overlaps however, with the Xenites making their first attempt to control the galaxy.<br><br>Xenon is essentially an overhead shooter, where the player controls the ship and moves around the screen. However, the difference between Xenon and its sequel is that here the player actually controls the movement of the playfield (up or down) by simply moving the ship in the direction of choice. To do this in the sequel, players need to slam your ship against the bottom of the screen and pull back on the stick in order to reverse-scroll the playfield.<br><br>It also features a 3D playfield (some enemies, for example, will be mounted on hills of sort, where players can't shoot them). To combat these the player can transform its tank into a plane. The game then switches to the more familiar gameplay style as seen in other vertically scrolling shooters. The plane has to transform back into a tank again to combat most ground units.<br><br>In Xenon, upgrades are taken from destroyed enemies.

However, these ships need fuel, and that fuel is find in the form of "klyston pods", which must be recovered from a range of hostile environments. <br><br>Your task is to fly your small spaceship above and below ground, capturing the pods. Your spaceship can rotate in 360 degrees, allowing for easy movements through the cavesystems, if it wasn't for gravity pulling you down, and intertia which means you could crash into walls or other objects if you don't turn around and thrust in the other direction. <br><br>Each level is cleared by recovering the klystron pods, which are the same thing as the ball you pick up in Thrust. Pick up the pod with your tractor beam, and a towing line will be attached. Towing the ball means that you have another object altering your course, though; if you break quickly, the forces of intertia will make the ball travel forward, pulling you in its direction. At later levels, the pod becomes heavier, and must be pulled using a force field. Travelling too fast will make the ball slip out of the field, forcing you to pick it up again, possibly from a very dangerous area.<br><br>The levels are guarded by cannons, which can be shot down using either your conventional cannon or a laser cannon. Beware, though, for the laser eats up your fuel supplies very quickly. Refueling is possible by activating the tractor beam above the fuel pods stationed throughout the levels.<br><br>Whereas Thrust used vector graphics, or something with a similar look, Zarathrusta uses detailed bitmap graphics, making for a different look for a similar game.

Description=Zork: The Great Underground Empire is a classic text adventure game.  The player begins as an "adventurer" standing near a white house in a nice forest, but soon descends into the Great Underground Empire, where most of the game takes place. The player's quest is to collect the Nineteen Treasures of Zork. <br><br>As was typical for adventure games of its era, Zork does not use graphics. Instead, it communicates with the player via text, and the player interacts with the game by typing commands, such as "examine mailbox" or "take torch". For movement, the player types in geographical directions (such as "north" or "east" - or just "n" and "e"), and can check what items are being carried with the "inventory" command (or just "i"). <br><br>Zork was ported over from mainframes in the late 1970s. It is one of the first "text adventures" and is widely considered to be one of the great classics of the genre which reached the peak of its popularity in the '80s.

Description=The Zork Trilogy is a compilation of all three of Infocom's original Zork games - Zork I, Zork II and Zork III -- and including the famous and ultimate feelie: the "Zorkmid Coin". This pioneering IF work was originally called Dungeon; it was too large for most computers at the time, and was broken into three sections, which became the original Zork Trilogy.<br><br>The Original Zork Trilogy<br><br>Zork I: The Great Underground Empire<br>This is the first game in the trilogy that started it all, in which you are introduced to the Land of Quendor, also known as the Great Underground Empire. Your only starting equipment is an Elven sword, and an old brass lantern. You must battle the Thief and the Troll, and outwit the Cyclops, as well as sail the mighty Aragain River, and go Over The Rainbow. You must fetch each of the twenty treasures of Zork, return them to the Trophy Case, and then find the entrance to Zork II.<br><br>Zork II: The Wizard of Frobozz<br>Here you meet the Wizard of Frobozz, a senile mage who can only cast spells beginning with the letter "F".  These include "Freeze", "Fatigue", and "Fudge." (The last one turns things into... fudge.)  Also found here is the infamous Carousel Room, the unicorn, and the dragon. Your mission is to get all three orbs and free the demon, so you can get the wand from the wizard and move on to Zork III.<br><br>Zork III: The Dungeon Master<br>Zork III ties up the loose ends left by the first two Zorks. Here, you find out your purpose for being in Quendor. Also, you finally find the spot where you must utter the words "Hello Sailor", a phrase that has become a running gag in the series.

Description=Like its predecessor X-Out, Z-Out is a side-scrolling shoot 'em up. A horde of largely-organic enemies threaten the safety of your planet, and they must be destroyed over the course of six levels.There are power-ups available, but the game is less centered around these than some are. <br><br>Whilst some shoot 'em ups are much easier with a second player, Z-Out takes design steps to legislate against this. In a 2-player game, most power-ups are unavailable, and even those which are only come into effect on level 3. Another variation is that the 1-player mode uses restart points, but the 2-player mode does not, so as to keep both players in the same place.

Description=Zyconix is an arcade puzzle game.<br><br>Colored blocks raining down on a playfield, we’ve seen that before. Zyconix takes the Columns principle (align three or more bricks of the same color to make them disappear) and adds a few twists of its own:<br><br>1. First, there are no groups or columns of stones, only single blocks.<br>2.  Second, several of them slide down at once, and you select and move them with a cursor.<br>3. Third, only horizontal and diagonal lines disappear, but not stacks of the same color.<br><br>Add a few special objects from bombs to drills to a breakout ball that you can actually deflect grabbing a brick as a paddle, mix with four play modes (normal, pre-filled playfield and two time trial variants), and the result is a fast-pasted, tricky test of agility. <br><br>Two players can compete in split-screen mode, where each removed line turns the corresponding number of bricks on the opponent’s field into indestructible obstacle blocks. Soloists adjust the difficulty level by tweaking the number of blocks in a line (from three to six), number of colors and frequency of new stones appearing.

You pilot a spacecraft through the levels, shooting as many of the encroaching meanies and mounted turrets as possible. Power-up tokens are offered for shooting some, which can be used to obtain better weapons including ground-attack lasers, speed ups and multiple bullets. Extra lives are on offer as well, which you'll certainly need, especially as you have to go back a long way when losing a life.

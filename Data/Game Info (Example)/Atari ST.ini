Each location will have a clue, but not all clues will be useful.  <br><br>Before solving the case, players must visit Scotland Yard for a badge.  Players might also want to use a badge to lock a location with a useful clue, requiring other players to detour to the locksmith.

The alien formations change every four waves, but not before a bonus stage involving navigating an asteroid field is passed.

Or, despite Infogrames' martial marketing efforts, 7 Colors might just be a puzzle game with brightly colored diamonds. <br><br>In the wake of Alexey Pajitnov's block-busting Tetris, Infogrames licensed another Russian mathematician's concept for a game of logics and dexterity: Two players start from opposite ends of a board, filled with rectangles of seven different colors, and take turns in picking one of these colors. All diamonds of that color bordering on the player's territory are annexed, expanding the borders. Whoever first controls more than half of the terrain wins.<br><br>Some quirks add tactical depth: The color chosen is locked for the opponent for one turn; drawing lines from one border of the field to another fills all the space in between. In addition, boards come in various diamond sizes, color textures and with obstacle stones. A (generous) time limit exerts soft pressure.<br><br>7 Colors can be played against the computer or a human opponent, even over a local network - a rare feature at the time. Ambitious players may design their own boards with the included editor.

In ADS, the Onslaught is not part of a flotilla.<br><br>There's no campaign, gameplay is mission-based and set in three scenarios (two in the CPC version) with five mission each: The Mediterranean around Sicily, the English Channel between UK and France, and the North Sea coast of Norway. Objectives include seek-and-destroy assignments, patrols, convoy escorts, submarine hunts and blockade runs. Each scenario also offers an open “Delta” option where you cruise and hunt without specific objectives.<br><br>You navigate the destroyer manually, in real-time and from a first person perspective, though with the help of a scenario map. ADS simulates ship combat as a close-quarter exchange of torpedoes and cannon fire. In proximity to enemy land bases, Stuka fighters can attack and must be shot down with the cannons. Submarines are tracked with the sonar and can only be attacked once they surface. Enemy vessels include freighters, tankers, torpedo boats, destroyers and cruisers. Most missions are time critical; in the course of the mission, it may be necessary to dock in allied ports for repairs, to refuel and restock on ammunition.

Description=Ancient Art of War is a real-time strategy game based on the very basic elements of war: unit types, formation, and strength.

A fourth non-combatant unit type is also available: "Spies", which is only available under certain campaign rule settings.  <br><br>The game consists of different scenarios to choose from, each with a different geographical setting, difficulty setting, visibility setting, and victory condition setting. Some settings may be subject to change by the player.<br><br>Gameplay is represented in two major areas:<br><br>1. The first is the tactical/political map, which visualizes geographical and terrain elements from a top-down perspective. Here the player can coordinate, position, reinforce troops, and also command them to attack, defend or ambush enemy troops in a real-time setting. Time may be set to pause, faster or slower to make battle plans easier;<br><br>The second is the combat screen where one group of soldiers fight another group of the enemy. A squad consisting a maximum of 14 soldiers will fight according to their set battle formation and will act only on the player's real-time battle commands (e.g. attack, forward, retreat, etc.).<br><br>The difficulty setting is based on real-historical characters, (with the exception of possibly) Crazy Ivan as the easiest and Sun Tzu as the hardest opponent. Each opponent has a different fighting style of combat and strategy.<br><br>Construction Set<br>The game also comes with a construction set which allows the player to create own campaigns: From the story, rules to the map editor.

The polar ice caps have melted, turning the surface of the earth into many islands of decaying land masses, known as Archipelagos. Man then built systems to try to clean up the pollution, but these failed. The only life left were genetically-altered plants made in an effort to clean up the waste -- these also turned hostile. It is up to you to clean up the earth, island by island.  <br><br>Controlling a hoversphere, it is up to you to make Earth's many islands of land habitable. To do this, you need to knock out the radiation generators on each island, which can be done by knocking out each generator's power sources (there are several per island). Once these are knocked out, you have 90 seconds to get back to the generator and disable it before it melts down, taking you with it.<br><br>Obstacles, unfortunately for you, are plentiful: You can't knock out a power source unless it is connected by a "land bridge" to the generator. You have the ability to create land where needed, but this takes up energy, and you have a limited supply. Also a hindrance are the many genetically-altered entities left behind on the islands: Viral trees that poison the ground; necromancers (former hoverspheres) that now erode land instead of creating it; eco eggs that explode on touch; and aircleaners, who are ruthlessly efficient in cleaning up the air -- and everything else, including you.<br><br>The entire game plays from a 3D first-person viewpoint.

Description=The message used our frequency, but it didn't come from any of our commanders. It couldn't be! After verifying its content, there was no room for doubt: a spaceship of our defense forces of the future had problems, but it had problems in our time. How was that possible?<br><br>The ship has been infiltrated by foreign forces and was going to crash in the Arctic zone, which was under enemy control. The question arose immediately -- Could they seize our technology of the future...? It can't be allowed!<br><br>Our best man must go into the enemy base to reach the rest of the ship and take off. Objective: to obtain our technology of the future. The mission doesn't seem easy. For that reason, it has been entrusted to Derdhal, who had already been victorious in dangerous missions in Army Moves and Navy Moves (with the same gaming style), demonstrating a deep knowledge of all the guerrilla techniques and expertise in handling computer networks.<br> <br>The U-92 submarine leads you to the enemy base. When you are above the frozen surface of the Arctic, there will be no return. Your first mission will start. Good Luck! You cannot fail.

Description=The original Breakout concept involves controlling a bat at the bottom of the screen and using it to catch and direct a ball so as to hit all the bricks which are arranged at the top of the screen. It was unpopular for over a decade, before Taito revived it with some new ideas in this arcade game.<br><br>The game's plot redefines the bat as a Vaus spaceship, the ball as an energy bolt, and the bricks form a mysterious wall stopping the ship from progressing to safety.<br><br>By the mid-80s, power-ups were popular in most types of arcade games, and Arkanoid features them. They are caught by positioning the bat below them as they fall (meaning that you risk missing the ball if you go for them at the wrong time). The power-ups include lasers (which are mounted to each side of the ship and allow you to shoot out the blocks), a catching device (so as to be able to fire the ball off at a different angle every time you hit it) and one that slows the ball.... sorry, bolt.... down. Needless to say, the game inspired tonnes of clones, few of which added anything else.

Finally, there’s an animated sequence for each go, which is depicted as an air strike. As well as standard two-player games, there’s also a multi-player mode in which the winner’s score accumulates until he loses, allowing for a “winner stays on” structure if there are 3 or more of you.

One day Taran notices that one of his pigs, Hen Wen has magical powers. The Evil Horned King wants the pig so that he can locate the Black Cauldron and ultimately rule the world. Taran must now embark on a mission to rescue Hen Wen and defeat the Evil Horned King before his can discover the Cauldron's location.<br><br>The Black Cauldron is a side-view adventure game. Gameplay is similar to other Sierra adventure games of its day (such as Space Quest II or King's Quest III) but does not use a text parser. Instead the function keys are used to initiate actions. Players control Taran and can make him walk, run, swim and interact (talk) with other characters in the game. Puzzle-solving and advancement in the plot requires item manipulation of using the right item at the right time or at the right location.

Making Jack's task difficult are numerous enemies such as birds, mummies, turtles, and orbs.<br><br>In each round, collecting a number of bombs results in a bonus coin appearing, and collecting this coin will make the player's score increase 2 to 4 times. More often than not, the "power ball" appears, and when you collect this, you can defeat enemies and have more time to collect all the bombs. There is also the "E" coin, which gives Jack one additional life, but rarely does this coin appear.<br><br>The more you progress through the game, the more difficult it becomes, as enemies travel more quickly to get you.

In these countries, where all strangers are suspect and all actions observed, paranoia and vulnerability are inescapable. In these countries, innocent travelers get caught in the web of international espionage. This is the setting for Border Zone. Border Zone consists of three chapters. In each chapter, you play a different character (an American businessman, a Western spy, and an Eastern spy) involved in unique puzzles and goals. The chapters take place at different times and at different locations; as a player, you will get the most satisfaction if you play the chapters in order. Border Zone has a built-in clock which drives the story forward. Unlike other Infocom stories, the clock in Border Zone continues to tick even while you stop to think. So if you find yourself in a dangerous situation, you can't just sit back and relax.

Squad members advance and act in turn on basis of a movement point system. <br><br>The multi-level maps consist of outside terrain and structures with several stories, connected by lifts, filled with enemies and objects. Squad members can find and use weapons such as grenades, rockets or detonation packs and tools such as Medikits, scanners or shields.<br><br>In an unique twist, the squad leader advances from mission to mission (while the rest of the team is always new), improving his basic stats with each successfully completed assignment, based on his performance. Only experienced leaders may attempt STAR-rated scenarios. If the squad leader gets killed, he is lost forever: the game deletes the corresponding leader file.

Description=Buffalo Bill presents a collection of six Wild West themed mini-games, which hang together around humour-lead presentation and backdrops.You can play as many or as few of these as you like, and can always have another go at them if you fail.<br><br>First task is to throw knives at a spinning board upon which a surely-terrified and fortunately-skinny lady is locked  - make sure to adjust for the rotation that will occur in the time your shot takes to hit. You get points for missing as many times as possible before hitting. Event 2 is based on shooting ability and is in two stages. First you must shoot the targets of criminals (but not innocents) as they emerge from the ground, next you must shoot the bottles they throw at you from over the horizon.<br><br>Event 3 is Calf Roping, in which you must position yourself so as to be able to throw your rope around the poor cow's neck. This is followed by Bronco Riding, in which you must adjust your balance to compensate for the Bronco trying to throw you off, by pushing the joystick out to balance two bars. Level 5 starts off like the Cow Roping, as you jump onto a Steer, before a joystick-waggling section starts. Last of all is a side-scrolling game in which you jump onto a stagecoach which has been invaded by Indians, and beat up the hijacker.

Collecting ‘EN’ symbols will restore your energy, and ‘IQ’ symbols increase the ability of your hatchlings to track and hit your foes. Be careful when placing blocks; it is possible to shut yourself in.<br><br>The single-player game gives you three lives, plus another when you complete each of the 50 levels. The multi-player game can be played in 2 different ways – co-operative (work together to clear the computer of bugs) or competitive (Dynablaster-style free-for-all destruction).

Melba is an easy-going guitar player who is having a picnic with his girlfriend; suddenly, an ultra-strong, evil-looking character appears and kidnaps the poor girl, sailing away on his ship. The brave Melba swims after the ship, and finds a bottle with a map inside. Knowing now the way to the evil kidnapper's lair, Melba embarks on a journey without further hesitation!<br><br>The premise, the map with the "stages", and the side-scrolling view indicate a platform-type action game; in reality, however, Builderland is a puzzle game, somewhat similar to the famous  Lemmings. As in Lemmings, the player has no control over the protagonist himself (except on a few occasions, when "boss" enemies must be defeated by throwing certain objects at them). Instead, the player must manipulate the environment in order to build a path for Melba, deal with the enemies, etc. Melba is for the most part entirely helpless and simply walks forward automatically. Various items such as boxes, weapons, platforms, etc., must be collected and placed properly in order to save the hero from premature death.

Description=Your task is to infiltrate Megalomann's desert headquarters, the Doom Tube. This consists of three cylinders, one inside the other, each divided into several decks (levels) which are subdivided into quadrants (rooms). They are interconnected by an elevator, the Orbivator.<br>The virus has, however, leaked into some of the rooms - some are more poisonous than others - and through the Captain has been injected with a protective serum, if a quadrant is too toxic it will kill him. The serum that keeps him alive is only temporarily effective but the ingredients to make more can be produced in the Converter quadrant.<br>The Converter is activated by touching certain wall panels and placing sufficient quantities of Ying and Yang (the ingredients) in receiver plates. Ying and Yang can be obtained by blasting a doom pod found in one of the quadrants.<br>You carry a nearly indestructible shield to deflect projectiles and nearly all energy beams. In some rooms, however, rotators are active and send out lethal beams. On destruction these rotators release a codeword which can be helpful in accessing later areas of the Doom Tube.<br>If you can reach the final deck of the Doom Tube, you may be able to disarm the missile - but the game is played in real time, and you are given just one hour to save the world.

Resource islands provide materials that factory islands can use to build weapons and vehicles to replace your combat losses but both will be quickly overrun if the enemy attacks them while you are not present.  You also have to ensure that your stockpiles of equipment are stored safely until you can find time to launch a resupply drone to bring them to your carrier.<br><br>From your carrier, you can take first person control of your attack aircraft and amphibious tanks and use them to assault enemy islands or even the enemy carrier itself if you're lucky enough to find it.

Description=The first football (‘soccer’ to you Americans; how come your game called ‘football’ features virtually no kicks, and even then only from 2 designated players?) game to challenge the supremacy of the Kick Off series. The graphical view is from a distance overhead, making the players small on screen but making around half the pitch visible. <br><br>The basic control system involves loose control, making running with the ball (‘dribbling’ in football parlance) a skill to master, and putting the emphasis on  one-touch passing, which can be easily performed by tapping the fire button.<br><br>The game features customisable league and cup competitions as well as pre-set ones including the 1992 European Championships. There are 168 teams in total, 40 European nations, the 64 top club sides, and 64 custom teams with names ranging from self-indulgent to comical, and their details are fully editable. At club and country level, each team has 3 star players who are more gifted that the others, use them wisely.

Description=Baron von Bansai has stolen Terry's precious collection of crystals, and dropped them onto 32 different kingdoms, so Terry sets off to retrieve them. Viewed from above, his challenge sees him having to progress through these worlds, collecting keys to gain access to different sections, and avoiding enemy balls and bugs by jumping them where possible. There are no 'lives' as such, but there's a strict time limit of around 400 seconds for the whole game, and death puts you back to the start of the level, with time lost as well. You get an extra 80 seconds for completing each level though.<br><br>The levels feature all manner of further hazards - there are holes in the ground to avoid falling through (some visible, some hidden), arrows which force the ball in a particular direction, slippery squares making any movement's effect exaggerated, magneted squares making it impossible to jump from, and many more. Fortunately lots of power-ups, time boosts and bonus fruits are dropped onto the levels at random intervals as well.<br><br>To complete the game you must clear 8 levels, and the structure is non-linear - initially you have a choice of 4 levels, and after completing one of those you have a choice of 4 more levels (which are different depending on which level you completed first). The third and fourth levels you take on as you go through the game are chosen from a choice of 3, the fifth and sixth from a choice of two, and only those final two levels are perscribed (although they do vary depending on which levels you've already done).<br><br>Each of the 32 worlds has its own twist - Arrow Kingdom has a large amount of arrows directing you, Ice Kingdom is especially slippery, Unseen Kingdom leaves you to work out the route for yourself (other than the holes, which are all you can see), Box Kingdom involves a lot of flying over some trapped squares to grab the keys they contain before making the main jumps onto the sections which contain crystals, and so on.

On the first one, you will be on a wild island, a place in which we will have to face endless hordes of pirates whose only obsession will be killing us. Some of them will use all kind of deadly weapons, such as the famous saber or a blunderbuss. Luckily for us and unfortunately for them, our protagonist is quite capable when it comes to fight with punches and kicks. So if all goes well, you will find a small boat which is awaiting you at the other extreme of the island.<br><br>The second part, to which we can access without the need of finishing the first one, takes place in a pirate galleon. There we will have to represent the role of the hero once again and we should try to rescue the beautiful damsel. Now the game system is quite different from the first part, because we will be no longer able to directly blow our enemies, but we will have to use a sword to finish with all of them. The objective consists in ascending to the pirate flags which are in the different masts of the ship and, in the end, to arrive where the girl is before she ends being food for sharks.

When Inspector Raoul Dusentier is invited to a cruise upon a mighty sailing ship by the wealthy businessman Niklos Karaboudjan, he looks forward to nothing but a relaxing week on the sea. Instead, his host manages to get himself killed on the second day. Murdered, to be exact. Too convenient that a policeman is aboard -- Dusentier sets out to search for suspects. He doesn't need to search long. Why is it that none of the family members seem awfully sad about the demise of the old man? Is the mysterious Father Fabiani really as pious as he says? In the best tradition of Agatha Christie, each and every person on board has a motive for the murder.<br><br>You advance in the plot not so much by solving common object-based puzzles, but by talking to the right persons about the right subjects at the right time, thus collecting clues. You will also find pieces of evidence scattered throughout the ship. However, most items suddenly appear in cupboards and drawers that were previously empty -- an awfully unnerving process. The clock advances in ten-minute-steps whenever you discover an interesting clue, which conveniently informs you of your progress. The protagonists move around the ship; so whenever time passes, different persons to talk to might appear at certain locations.<br><br>With Cruise for a corpse, Delphines Cinematique interface reached &quot;Evolution 2&quot;. Instead of containing a fixed number of verbs, the command menu is now context-sensitive. The mouse cursor will change its appearance when moved over an interesting object; a left-click brings up a set of appropriate verbs. For example, a cupboard may be opened and searched, whereas a key can be picked up and turned. A right-click accesses the inventory. Another interesting improvement: All the persons in the game are animated polygons (see Trivia).

As in Defender, a radar at the top warns you of obstacles and enemies which you would otherwise crash into at high speed. <br><br>The obstacles are made up of asteroids, which split up when shot. If you destroy the smaller fragments, they will release small crystals which grant you bonus points. But crystals also draw in greedy enemies. Similar to Defender and Dropzone, there is a large assortment of enemies with specific behaviours, weapons and attack patterns, such as quick, relentless hunters homing in on you, slow bombers and spinners with spread fire. Destroyed enemies release power-ups from time to time, such as shields, faster fire rates and multi-directional fire. At certain intervals are special stages with enemy bosses and fortresses.<br><br>While only the Amiga version has music on the title screen, both it and the ST version feature only sound effects and sampled speech during gameplay.

Description=Following in the footsteps of the early UNIX game Robots (and perhaps from there the still-earlier BASIC game Chase?), this game puts the player in charge of a little protagonist, often claimed to be The Doctor, occupying a position on a top-down grid which is otherwise strewn, not with mines, but with those killer cyborgs which are his personal nemesis, the Daleks.  They have no long-range weapons, but if they touch him, he will find himself ex-ter-min-ated!<br><br>Fortunately for him, contact with them is as lethal to each other as it is to him.  Every time he takes a step, they all draw one square closer to him; The Doctor's cunning strategy is to manoeuvre himself so as to cause their paths to intersect and the Daleks to terminally collide, leaving a pile of rubble dangerous both to him and to subsequent Daleks -- a strategy not always possible on the narrow confines of a grid.  Fortunately for the good Doctor, where this game outdoes its predecessors is that he also has his trusty Sonic Screwdriver in hand, whose offensive use destroys all Daleks within a threatening one-square radius of him.  Also, it allows him to teleport out of harm's way to a random location on the map -- hopefully one behind a pile of Dalek rubble, and not one within a single step of a Dalek currently on the map.  In many versions both Sonic Screwdriver and Teleport use are limited.  Should The Doctor survive this onslaught, he is brought to a new grid map, generally one populated with still further Daleks.<br><br>Other features particular to some versions and absent from others include the use of graphical tiles vs. mere roguelike textmode character representation, and occasionally a conversion will use (universally unlicensed) sound effects taken from canonical Doctor Who sources; more commonly these games also offer a Last Stand command, to be used, like the "drop" in Tetris, when the player is so confident in the security of their location that they are willing to sit tight and grant the Daleks as many moves as it takes to either reach The Doctor or be rendered down into scrap metal through unforeseen collision.  Successful use of the Last Stand often results in a score bonus; unsuccessful use of it, of course, results in The Doctor's death.  (Don't worry, chances are good that he'll regenerate into a new incarnation -- not in this game, however.)<br><br>Some versions feature keyboard directional control (in which sometimes the player is granted access to diagonal movement like the Daleks are, and sometimes not), while others present The Doctor with a halo of directional arrows around him, to move him one step in the appropriate direction if an arrow is clicked upon.  Generally he also has the option of standing in place and passing a turn.

Description=MicroProse made a change from military simulations by recreating golf in fine detail. This was the first golf game to operate in true 3D. This means that the player's stance and swing technique can be adjusted, and have a significant effect on the shot outcome. Although the manual's tutorial helps, it's harder to master than rivals such as PGA Tour Golf. There are six courses, an unprecedented number for a computer simulation, and tonnes of playing modes.

If you mentally change the driver names, it can be thought of as a recreation of real NASCAR racing rather than a direct recreation of the film. <br><br>You play Cruise's Cole Trickle character (his name, like many of the others, is slightly different to that of a real NASCAR racer of the day) against your rivals on 8 tracks, based on real-life counterparts. The races are all on ovals, although the exact lengths, corner types and gradients are varied.  This means that the ideal racing line on one track can put you into the wall on another. Qualifying is incorporated alongside the races themselves.<br><br>From times to times you'll have to pull into the pit stop area. When doing so, you control the five members of the pit crew. Loosing time on pit will make you loose positions at the race. The other racers, however, never pit.<br><br>The NES version has 3rd-Person perspective only.

Description=Die Hard 2: Die Harder is a 2D shooting gallery.<br><br>In the early 90’s, two things just wouldn’t die: Bruce Willis in the Die Hard trilogy of movies, and, well, 2D point-and-click shooters. Renowned software undertaker Grandslam was happily ready to dig the grave several inches deeper for both. The spade: a game called Die Hard 2: Die Harder.<br><br>Based on the 1990 movie Die Hard 2, the program sends you through five stages modelled after key scenes of the film. As N.Y. cop John McClane, you have to shoot terrorists invading Washington’s Dulles airport by quickly aiming a crosshair at them. You’ll successively clear the luggage center, airport annexe and runway, then chase after the bad guys on a snowmobile and finally shoot it out on the wing of the terrorist’s plane. Each stage consists of three screens; on the last one, several tougher bosses will appear. Occasionally, civilians cross the room and pray that you don’t kill them. Most dying terrorists drop power-ups, namely med-kits, armour, grenades and weapons that are more powerful or fire faster. You collect these items by shooting them in time. If you do not aim fast enough, the terrorist’s bullets will drain your health; you may die three times, but after that, John McClane bites the dust once and for all. Until you restart, that is.<br><br>For more information on the movie Die Hard 2, see the trivia and links sections.

Your weapon is a disc, which you can throw at your opponent or at the walls. The disc will ricochet off the walls, opening a wide range of angles and attacks. You can also try a direct hit at your opponents, as enough of these will eliminate him as well, but be careful - since it gives him a chance to block your disc, thus gain control of it!<br>As you progress through the levels, from Novice, through Disciple, up to a Great Guide, your rivals become tougher, platforms take longer hits to disappear, and there are more discs on the playing field.

Flintheart Glomgold challenges Scrooge to a competition to see who the richest duck in the world is. They each have 30 days to see who can get the most money together and finally their dispute will be settled.<br><br>Scrooge’s office is your headquarters. Here you have three options – you can go exploring for treasure, play the stock market or dive into your money bin, occasionally finding a rare coin which adds to you treasure total. You need to get some money first before you can play the stock market though.<br><br>You main source of income comes from the exploration map which hangs on the wall. From here, you can pick a destination, which you can travel to. There are four different scenarios when travelling to various parts of the world. It’s these levels that are the most fun. You can choose to go mountain climbing, jungle bashing, search a cavern, or photograph some rare animals depending on your location. On screen information tells you which scenario it is, how long the trip will take and how much the treasure is worth. There’s also an island in the Indian Ocean you can visit to check on who’s winning between you and Glomgold.<br><br>You have to fly to each location and your transport is LaunchPad McQuack! You have to take off at the airport and fly to the destination. There are obstacles along the way though, watch out for powerlines (these are really funny, you run into them and boing! bounce back); hot air balloons dropping refrigerators, anvils, 10 ton weights and pianos; cumulo nimbus clouds shooting lightening and fluffly clouds; whales blowing water out their spouts; tall mountains, rocky outcrops, fireworks, hay barns among other things. Landing on the other side requires a special skill … Launchpads! You have to crash into the airport to land! Crash the plane though and it takes two days of your valuable time limit for Gyro Gearloose to fix it.<br><br>Using Huey, Dewey and Louie, each being one of your three lives in the mountain climbing level, you must get from the base of the mountain to the top to get your treasure. Using the boys, you can hop from ledge to ledge, or when the going gets tough, use your grappling hook! This is a lot of fun and requires precision. There are also caves in the side of the mountain, which can transport you up or down the mountain. But watch out for bears in the caves. Other obstacles include falling rocks, the Beagle Boys dropping objects from above, mountain goats, Magica de Spell and more.<br><br>The jungle features Scrooges’ nephews again. Here you must use swinging vines, branches and even hippopotamus’ backs to get to the treasure. Sleeping pumas, snakes, macaws and monkeys hamper you progress.<br><br>Searching a cavern involves Scrooge, his nephews and niece, navigating a maze using the map at the bottom of the screen to get to the treasure whilst avoiding the yeti tracking them down.<br><br>Photography, with Webbigail, Scrooge’s niece, involves her taking snaps of rare animals in a forest. Some animals get you more money for your snaps than others.<br><br>Once the thirty day marker is reached, whoever has the most gold between Scrooge and Glomgold is the winner.

This leads to six levels of horizontally-scrolling shoot ‘em up action, although with some vertical movement as well.<br><br>The thing which sets the game apart from every other horizontally-scrolling shoot ‘em up (except Saint Dragon) is that you are riding on the back of a dragon, called Bahamoot. Both you and the dragon have firepower, and holding down the fire button increases Bahamoot’s energy bolt’s ferocity. The dragon’s tail can be controlled indirectly, and because it is indestructible, it can be used either as a shield, or as a weapon in its own right. <br><br>There are power-ups to collect by dismounting from the dragon and walking into them. These include fiery breath, bolts shot from Bahamoot’s tail, homing missiles of sorts, and lightning bolts, with only one ever active at a time. Each level has a time limit.

Use alchemy to strengthen (or even weaken) own dragons or use them to cast spells at surrounding villages and cities (as well as some alchemical spells for the player's own benefit). Creating a too powerful spell in the Magick Laboratory may introduce an unpleasant explosion in the lab. Ingredients may be obtained through villager tribute or purchase from traveling merchants. <br><br>Note: The game is almost impossible to play without the Alchemical Table of Ingredients.<br><br>Dragon Breeding<br>The player may breed several individual dragons in the castle. Each require nurturing and patience before they can hatch and even more so after they hatch! Use alchemy spells to help strengthen the dragon eggs (or they may not hatch at all!).<br><br>Dragon Missions and Political Map<br>This feature gives a top-down perspective of the political map around the land. Send dragons to wreck havoc and terror to the surrounding villages and cities, or use them to explore the region and even protect villages and cities from enemy dragons! Attacking villages and cities may prompt them to surrender themselves under the player's control, providing the damage done is sufficient enough. This is also where the player may control the taxation of villages and cities (under player control) as well as any other information regarding them.<br><br>Dragon Combat!<br>Though optional, the player may enter manual combat (as to automatic combat) and enter a top-down, side-scrolling (vertical) arcade combat when attacking villages or cities. Here the player basically uses a dragon to burn anything that remotely looks like a structure.<br><br>Note: If there is an enemy dragon near the area, the enemy dragon will come to the defense of that village or city!

Then you could buy weapons, spells, and armor and go on your adventure.  Weapons came in five different types: Axe, Bow, Mace, Spear, and Sword.  There were three types of armor: Leather, Chain, and Plate. There were several spells: Blast, a damage spell, Power, which had random effects, Heal, which healed you, and Speed, which increased your chance to hit.<br><br>Character development was fairly simple.  Your character started with random stats in three categories: Hardiness (how much you could carry and the amount of damage you could take), Agility (How good you were in combat) and Charisma (Affected the costs of items in the store and the friendliness of monsters).  You also had percentage ratings for each of the weapon types that determined, along with the armor penalty, whether you could hit or not.  These percentage ratings had a chance of going up every time you hit a monster with that type of weapon.<br><br>The game was almost entirely text-based. There were a few adventures that made use of graphics, but they were the exception rather than the rule.  You interacted with your environment using simple one or two-word adventure game commands such as ATTACK RAT, INVENTORY,  or NORTH.  There was no option to save your game in most of the adventures, so death was often quick, sudden, and final.  <br><br>Since Eamon was in the public domain, other people started writing their own adventures with the Eamon Dungeon Designer disk. You could make a good hack-and-slash adventure in an afternoon or two  or you could spend lots of time writing modifications and special effects into your game by adding to the main game program, which was written in Applesoft BASIC.  Over 240 adventures were written for the Eamon system, with themes running from fantasy to mystery to movie knock-offs (one of my favorites was the Quest for the Holy Grail).<br><br>The Eamon game was expanded over the years to include more sophisticated inventory management, shortened commands, and better monster handling.  A commercial version was sold for a while and an expanded and more sophisticated version of Eamon called Swordthrust was developed by Donald Brown, but it never enjoyed the success of it's predecessor.

Description=Eco is an action strategy game of sorts, which sets you in charge initially of a small single-celled organism, and challenges you to guide its evolution. Your initial tasks are to roam around finding food, and then find a potential mate. Depending on your organism's status, different predators will be after you - a radar is displayed to indicate where these are at any given time. Once this is done, you are taken to a screen displaying the species' genes, and you have the chance to modify one of them, thus resulting in evolution. Eventually you can evolve far enough to become plant, insect, fish or even human.

Description=Elvira - a horror movie star, a witch, and your girlfriend - is in trouble. A demon Cerberus has kidnapped her in order to kill her and gain her power. To save Elvira, you arrive at the studios of Black Widow Productions, where she is being held. Unfortunately, the whole studio is filled with monsters, as the horror movie sets have turned real. <br><br>Elvira II: The Jaws of Cerberus is an adventure/RPG first-person game. You begin by choosing one of the four classes for your character (which determines your starting attributes, such as Strength, Intelligence etc.). <br><br>For movement, you click the arrows in the bottom-right corner of the screen. Collecting items can be done via clicking on them in the first-person view window and dragging them into your inventory. (You can also click the "room" icon to see all the items that you've found in the room so far.) Should you encounter monsters, you fight by clicking on them. You can choose one of the four tactics (Normal, Defense, Fierce, Berserk) when fighting, and there's a number of different weapons you can find in the game. If you meet someone who doesn't want to murder you (a very rare occurrence) you can talk to him, though conversations are pretty simple and consist mainly of short phrases. <br><br>As you defeat monsters, explore the game world and cast spells (see below), you get experience. Once you have enough experience, you gain a level, and your attributes improve. <br><br>Thanks to Elvira's spellbook she gave you, you have the ability to create and cast spells. Some spells can be used to heal yourself, protect you in combat or damage your enemies, other are necessary to solve certain puzzles and make progress in the game. Creating a spell requires you to be of high enough level and to have the proper ingredients, different for every spell. The ingredients are usually gone forever once the spell is ready, so beware and don't use up any items vital for completing the game! Casting a spell requires you to use some amount of Power Points (PP), which regenerate automatically but slowly. What's more, you only get a limited number of castings when you prepare a spell, so don't waste them.

Description=Crime is getting out of control in Liberty City, and to combat the problem, the LCPD establishes a new unit, called ESWAT (Enhanced Special Weapons and Tactics). Police officers who are promoted to this unit wear a cyber-suit that contains state-of-the-art military equipment including two Turbo-Booster Thrusters, extra ammunition, and increased protection. In order to become an ESWAT member, all a dedicated police officer has to do is arrest enough criminal masterminds to progress through the ranks, which include Captain, Assistant Chief, and Chief.<br><br>ESWAT: Cyber Police is a horizontal-scrolling beat 'em up where you have to make your way from left to right and defeat a mastermind. There are 15 stages to complete, and have you patrolling through Liberty streets, car yards, stadiums, restaurants, the CBD, construction sites, and boat docks. While you're out on patrol, you can pick up ammunition, and the amount you get varies. For example, on some levels, ammo may be worth 10 bullets, while in others, you may get 60 bullets. Once you have obtained the cyber-suit, you wear it for the duration of the game.

The tournament's structure of the time (2 groups of 4 play each other once, top 2 go through to semi-finals followed by a final) is recreated, with any of Europe's soccer nations available to be chosen as those 8, and 1 or 2 human players choosing their team, playing on either keyboard or joystick.<br><br>The matches are played from a side-scrolling perspective. The ball sticks to the player's foot, and can be kicked or passed with a press of the fire button. The referee is fairly lenient when it comes to tough sliding tackles, although fierce contact will result in a free kick being given.

Description=This action game combines shoot 'em up and platform elements, as you control a flying man who can gain an exoskeletal suit for extra protection (hence the name). Your task is to progress from left to right in each level, either along the ground or by using the arrangement of platforms. Most of the baddies can be avoided rather than shot, and this is often easier, especially as you can duck or jump to avoid them. As well as a standard gun (activated by tapping fire) you also have a limited number of missiles to take out installations (activated by holding down fire, which makes autofire facilities useless). The scrolling is flick-screen, perhaps as the game was designed for the C64, and the Amiga version was identical to the ST's.

While watching TV you see your name linked to a report about a mysterious murder. It is your job to unravel this conspiracy.<br><br>The interface of the game has a more minimalist approach this time, the icons were reduced to only three revolving on the bottom-right of the screen: a magnifying glass to examine the scenario, a hand to pick and drop things, and a hammer as the "use" verb. Above these icons there is a clock: the developers added a dimension of time to the proceedings, and certain actions can only be performed at an exact time point. This installment also ditches the synthesized speech of the second game. <br><br>The games of this series share a common trait of being quite unforgiving: the player can easily get stuck on a unwinnable situation by forgetting to take some crucial object or not performing the exact action at the exact time. Death also comes swiftly and unexpected, sometimes only by opening a door at the wrong moment.

Description=The screen display in Extase depicts a symmetrical network of wires, some buttons, some fuses, some switches, and a picture of a female android in the middle. The overall aim is to restore sensory functions to the android, one in each level. All of this is done against an opponent, either human or computer, who controls the opposite half of the board.<br><br>This is done by guiding electrical pulses through each of the wires, however this can only be done once the wires have been woken up. You are in control of a cursor, which can click on the activation buttons to release a ball, which you direct using the cursor to reactivate wires on its path. Switches must be set to make all parts of this available – this can only be done when no ball is active.<br><br>Electrical sparks move around to make life harder, by destroying balls and fuses. Fortunately these can be 'zapped' using the cursor. New fuses can be generated by guiding a power beam into the fusebox, which is located centrally – simply pick up and place a generated fuse.<br><br>Better still, you can steal your opponent's, which is one of many ways the game becomes directly competitive. The two cursors cannot occupy the same space on screen, so hitting your opponent's cursor will jolt it. You can also adjust switches on both sides of the board, and summon sparks for your opponent to deal with. As the android is reactivated during the level it shows a range of facial expressions as a visual reward and measure of your progress.

For those with the knowledge, it offers practice with the variables of flight, including the avionics. The Atari ST-release (1986), instead, simulates the Cessna 182 single engine propeller aircraft and the Gates Learjet 25G twin engine jet. <br><br>The simulator was considered to be a second generation product.  It had many more features than first generation flight simulators, and pilots were expected to pay attention to small details.  SubLOGIC encouraged the users of the game to go to flight stores and purchase flight-training manuals and aeronautical charts to help them understand the variables within the program.  The game was oriented toward pilots-in-training, but there were options for non pilots too: the company included an easy mode, and a slightly more detailed reality mode.  These modes did not require the same level of knowledge.<br><br>Flight Simulator II was also packaged with a WWI dogfighting game, called WWI Ace.  In this game your plane is armed with bombs, machine guns, and a radar screen.  The radar screen is anachronistic for a game set in World War I, but it is there to help gameplay.

There are five tasks to be undertaken – light all the fires, fetching a toy boat from the bath for Prince Andrew, some freckles for Fergie, a wig for Diana, and a mystery task for the Queen. To gain access to each room, you need the signatures of particular royals along the way. <br><br>Flunky is an arcade adventure using the same game system as other Don Priestley's Trapdoor license – large sprites overlaid onto block objects, seemingly designed around Spectrum attribute-clash issues. Many screens operate on more than 1 horizontal plane, so you can move your character in and out of the screens as well as across them.

Description=Tie-in of the rather unknown but truly brilliant board game of the same name. Up to four players land on a planet with their motherships, trying to gather as much ore as possible within 24 game rounds.<br><br>This almost sounds like a happy, idyllic round of pick-the-flowers... if it wasn't for the truckload of tanks and destroyers that each players happens to have in the cargo area of his mothership. So the players usually spend an equal amount of time picking up ore and bashing their contenders' heads in.<br><br>The computer game is an extremely accurate conversion of the board game - virtually every aspect has been taken care of.<br><br>What's especially refreshing about this game is that it does not rely on luck - it's pure strategy. The only semi-random thing are the tides (high tide, low tide, and something inbetween) which can strand boats and engulf tanks, but even they can be partially predicted.

Shooting involves holding down fire to get the height right, so avoid being tackled as you prepare your shot. Other basketball rules such as double-dribbling and the 25-second hand-over are unsurprisingly waived. A 3-division league is included to progress through.

You must knock globes into others of the same colour, to rid the screen of all the globes. The screen has no borders, so globes can be pushed off the side of the screen, increasing your tactical range. Knocking globes of different colors into each other produces smaller pods which need to be picked up quickly, giving you energy, or they will turn into globes and you will have to get rid of them too. Many of the globes are linked to other globes (or the ship) via string, and the level layouts include barriers as obstacles (and ricochet points), making the Newtonian physics more complex.

Description=Like so many other puzzle games of the time, this game involves tiles of different colours, which must be manipulated to clear a succession of increasingly-difficult levels.<br><br>The basic idea is that you are presented with 2 sets of tiles, and must make the left one identical to the 'control' set on the right. The colours are defined in a sequence - red, green, blue, purple, yellow - and when you click on a tile, that tile's colour moves forward by two in that sequence (for example a blue one becomes yellow), whereas the tiles next to it move by one colour (for example, blue becomes purple). <br><br>Any that move past the end fo the sequence disappear, causing surrounding blocks to drop. You get a limited number of moves, and limited time as well. Fortuantely there are passwords, delivered by cutely-drawn naked Japanese girls (although the private parts are covered up).

The disease must be stopped by whatever means necessary; whether by antibody injections, black market drugs, amputation, or all-out germ warfare. Just be sure that your patient doesn't suffer too much surgical abuse or else he will be greeted by Mr. Grim Reaper himself. On the flipside, being too careful may result in the rapid spreading of this hideous mutant virus, and the poor victim will literally rot away until all that remains is a skeleton!<br><br>The gameplay is complex and unique, and resembles a more biological version of Sim City. There are six levels of difficulty, but even at the easiest level, Germ Crazy is a difficult game to master. The subject matter, although undeniably grim, is tempered with a sadistic sense of humor throughout.

Initially our hero is armed with rocks, but extra weapons can be collected for specific tasks such as the bosses who end each level.

Although deserted for many years now, the gold still remains, along with only a few evil things and remnants of sorcery that watch over the treasure.<br><br>You remember a tale your grandfather has told of a disguised evil magician who had won the favor of the Four Princes and would serve as the Court Magician. They would later trust him to hide away the Realms riches within the Gray Castle, protected by his magic. But, once the gold was in his grasp, the magician rose up against the Princes, casting them out of the castles with powerful spells of magic. Legend also says demons rose up to destroy any that remained in the land, especially each of the Princes of the Realm. Very few survived to tell the tale. With only your work horse as company you leave on your quest. <br> <br>At the start of this game of exploration, you have a choice of difficulty, Easy, Medium, and Hard. The Easy level has one castle to explore with 79 different screens. The Medium level has two castles, and 159 different screens. The Hard level has four castles and 320 different screens. Each increased level of difficulty has more foes and obstacles to overcome, and more items to find. In addition, the Hard selection will randomize certain items and conditions giving 4096 possible games, which effectively makes Gold of the Realm always different whenever you start a new game.<br><br>Make your way through the castles by picking up items and using them when necessary. Pick up items by standing over the item and pressing the joystick button. The name of the item and its image will appear in the Status Bar. To use an item or drop an item from your inventory, its name must be showing in the Status Bar indicating that it is the current item. To drop an item, stand on a blank area of floor and press the joystick button once. (Items can only be dropped on wooden floors). <br><br>Avoid being touched by a spook - they will steal your current item and drop it somewhere in the Realm. Doors can be opened by standing near them and pressing the joystick button. Move up and down staircases by standing on the steps and pressing the joystick button. <br><br>Map and save often to succeed on your quest. If you have defeated all obstacles, and have the treasure, go back to your horse, and press the joystick button.

If that's not enough for Jerrod sell everything and give his hometown Brooklyn a fond adieu, under the stamp was one of the first nuggets of Californian gold seen in the Atlantic shores of the United States. So, Jerrod bids farewell to his peaceful life as a newspaper editor, and becomes a fore-runner in the the great Gold Rush of 1849, hoping to find his brother and "strike gold" (literally).<br><br>Released late into the lifespan of Sierra's AGI engine, Gold Rush! features some tricks not seen before the more advanced SCI engine, such as enlarged characters, but it is best known for the three routes available to reach California: by land, travel by boat to reach the Atlantic shore of Panama, cross the isthmus, and then get a second boat in the Pacific shore, or making the dangerous all-boat trip by Cape Horn. Each route has it's dangers: Cholera might strike as you make your way across the Northern states or your boat might sink.. As usual with Sierra adventures, instant killing happens if the player is careless, but will also happen at random. Other important (and innovative) concept is the game being timed. If Jerrod takes too long to leave Brooklyn, passages to California increase in price, and his house devalues.

Description=Hack is the precursor to NetHack, both members of the family of text-based Rogue-like games.  The gameplay of Rogue and its descendants is the quintessential computer role-playing game (RPG):  Choose a character class and venture forth into the dungeon to fight monsters and gain treasure.<br><br>Like all descendants of Rogue, Hack is displayed from a top-down view, painted with text characters.  The player ventures throughout the dungeon, visiting rooms connected by thin corridors.  Gameplay is turn-based, with the turn beginning with the player's action (move, attack, eat, cast spell, etc.).  Commands are mapped to various letters of the keyboard, including "i" for inventory, "e" for eat food, etc. with one exception:  Attacking a monster involves running into it, so the "attack" function shares the same keys as movement.<br><br>Hack is one of the first significant deviations from Rogue, notable by the rich interaction possible in the game world:  Simple actions result in complex (yet logical) reactions.  For example, it is not uncommon to throw a boomerang only to miss the target and have it return to hit the player; or kill a monster that has the ability to turn you to stone as an attack, then accidentally step on its carcass on the way out and turn to stone; or having a bolt of fire from a magic wand ricochet around the room, hit the player, and cause his magic scrolls to catch on fire; etc.  In addition, monsters and objects have secondary, hidden properties; for example, killing and eating a leprechaun will result in the player randomly teleporting to different locations.<br><br>Hack was originally written by Jay Fenlason, then heavily modified by Andries Brouwer.  Hack was ported to several different operating systems in 1986, then all the versions were merged into a single port by Mike Stephenson called NetHack, which deviated sufficiently significantly from any one version of Hack that it is considered a new game.

Description=Hacker is an adventure/trading game based on what was then a unique idea. You're starting into the adventure as a real hacker would do, lacking information of what is to come, only driven by your ambition. Consequently, the game opens with a plain text screen, prompting you for the login password. To break into the system is the first puzzle you've got to solve.<br><br>Once in, you'll soon find out that you've accidentally stumbled upon a conspiracy of global impact. From then on, you'll maneuver a robotic drone around the globe through a tunnel system deep in the earth. In major cities, you may surface and talk to contact persons, who'll trade items for cash. When delivered to the correct city, you can exchange these items for a piece of evidence. If all evidence is collected, you're to inform the FBI. As if figuring out the correct routes and trades wasn't hard enough, frequent system malfunctions and security checks test your skill as well...

Description=Hacker II: The Doomsday Papers is a real-time strategy game.<br>It is the sequel to Hacker <br><br>Once again you hack into a computer system, just to end up saving the world. Hacker II: The Doomsday Papers opens with the console to the "Actisource" computer hotline system (a nice self-ironic pun - although nobody knows why a serious hacker might want to crack a help service for computer games...). However, your quiet little hack is soon disturbed: The government wants you for a secret mission. It, again,  involves a robot drone and you're the one at the remote control. Although this time, it's not the whole globe that's your playground, but a high security facility in Russia, where the plans for global domination are hidden.<br><br>In fact, all you've got to do is to guide your drone to the vault on a 2D map of the building. However, there are two major obstacles: Patrolling guards and security cameras. To avoid detection, you've got to trick the observers. By tapping the surveillance system you can see what cameras are currently active and which rooms they monitor. Your task is to bypass the video signal of the right cameras with a taped recording of an empty room, so that your drone is hidden from the view. You control four monitors, which you may freely switch to show the security monitor, the radar map, VCR output or one of the 38 cameras -- thus keeping an eye on guard movement while simultaneously controlling your drone and synchronizing recordings to cameras. Whew, sounds like a lot of work? It is.

Description=Hard Drivin' is a 3D arcade hit from Atari Games. You are in control of a high-performance sports car. Your objective is to race around the course as fast as possible and hit as many checkpoints as possible. If you hit a checkpoint you gain extra time to go farther. You will see traffic on the road both in your direction and coming down the opposite direction, so be careful when you pass... <br><br>The course has two sections: speed track, and stunt track. Speed track is longer, but you can usually achieve higher speeds. Stunt track requires you to perform several stunts such as jumping bridges, driving through a loop, and so on. <br><br>Crashing the car has no serious consequences and indeed shows a replay of your crash from a cinematic angle. Admire your crash head-on into the cement truck, or clipping the minivan, or flying off the bridge in the wrong angle... You lose several seconds as your car is "reset" and you get up to speed again. <br><br>The home conversions retain most of the then-advanced 3D graphics but lack the force-feedback that was in the arcade version.

Description=The famous fantasy-themed board game was converted into an isometric-viewed role playing game in which the evil Wizard Morcar must be defeated. You take control of a wizard, a dwarf, a barbarian and an elf, each with different strengths and weaknesses, who each start the 14 missions from opposite sides of the board.<br><br>Strict turn-based movement rules apply, as actions other than movement can only be carried out before or after the move, the size of which is limited by a dice roll. These moves are carried out using an icon-based system. Characters can fight the many monsters which lurk, or cast spells to vanquish them. There are magic potions to uncover, but also hidden traps, so mapping is advised. Treasure can be collected, and traded at the shop after each level.

Take on various missions ranging from assassination to demolition in an effort to defeat the enemy within a time limit.<br><br>Fully 3D, you have the choice to go anywhere you please during any mission. A focus is put on freedom of choice; there's no one way to complete a mission. You can take control of any vehicle in the game, and these range from riding pedal bikes and windsurfing, to vans and ambulances, to tanks and armoured cars, to battleships and helicopters. Your arsenal includes grenades, explosives, various gadgets and a handgun, though deadlier weapons are mounted on some of the vehicles. Or if you prefer, you can acquire an enemy uniform and sneak in rather than blast your way through.<br><br>There are also many structures to be found, many containing regular citizens who may be interacted with (talking to them, bribing them...), though there are also more specialised structures which may contain vehicles, ammo, or anything you might find useful to your mission.

You're not too sure where he might be, but a dungeon is always a good place to look, so you seek out the nearest one and plunge into its depths. Beware: 8 levels of <br>isometric death await.<br><br>The Immortal is the prototype of a trial-and-error game. Progress is made by encountering a hazard, dying, solving the problem, encountering the next hazard. To solve a level, you have to know its traps and their patterns by heart. As frustrating as this may sound (it is), The Immortal quite cleverly balances annoyance with curiosity and graphical rewards. In short: You want to see what challenge lies in the next room.<br><br>The puzzles range from simple avoidance of traps to the correct use of items; you collect objects in an inventory. Every now and then, The Immortal surprises with a special challenge. For example, you've got to ride a magic carpet through a hallway full of fire traps, or ride a barrel on an underground river. The dungeon isn't empty: some friedlies may have valuable information or trade items, the nasty sort of guys will attack. Combat is fought man-to-man on a special screen. Your adversary indicates his next attack a few seconds before he executes it, so you've got time to react appropriately. You can dodge to the left or the right, as well as attack from these two directions. There is no save option in the game, of course, but you may restart each level as often as you like. Levels can be skipped by entering passwords.

Description=Seven-a-side rugby union is brought to life in this budget game.  The action is viewed from the side, although kicks to the posts are played from a behind-the-posts perspective. Scrums and line-outs are incorporated for as realistic a game as possible given the player restriction. A tournament can be played with up to 8 players, with as many computer teams as required to fill the gaps.<br><br>In the ST version the tactical side of the game is very complex - seventeen different formations are on offer. Other gameplay variables can be set - player stamina (lower values forcing you to play a more conservative game), how long a player takes to recover from a tackle, and the standard strengths of passes and kicks, pus some very complicated mathematical coefficients. The ability to rename teams, change kits and alter the match lengths seem banal by comparison.

Description=International Soccer Challenge is loosely a sequel to MicroProse Soccer and it has many similarities to the original, including the way the ball sticks to your player's foot. The major difference is the visual perspective, which is in pure 3D, viewed just behind the ball as you move up the pitch, with full polygons and some shading. You have a radar on screen to allow you to see where your team-mates are, which reduces the disadvantage of not being able to look behind you.<br><br>Two tournaments are featured - a superleague and a recreated World Cup, as well as practice modes. By moving the joystick as you shoot, you can adjust the direction and height of a pass or shot, allowing for a wide range of moves.

Some characters are helpful, others are not.  But the right combination of your actions will help you to become Caliph instead of the Caliph, while the wrong ones will often land you in a cell beneath the palace.

You can practice flying and aerobatics in "free flight" mode, dogfight against Soviet MiGs, launch strikes against land or sea based targets, watch a demo, or load a subLOGIC scenery disk.  For either combat mode, you get to select which missiles and bombs your plane will have.<br><br>Most of the indicators a real jet fighter would have are present:  altimeter, heading, frame loading, gear status, brake status, fuel level, radar, attitude, and range.  You can turn a few of these on and off.  Controls consist of either the joystick or numeric keypad for steering and other keys to handle your optional indicators, landing gear, weapons, and even the eject button!  Lastly, if you want a different perspective, you can get a view from the control tower instead of your cockpit.

Formations can be selected by placing each player in a precise position alongside the formation of the opposition team, using a fairly advanced system for the time. Via a separate menu you can consult with the chairman (to see if he's happy with your efforts), the physio (to check for injuries), the scout (who comes up with players you might like to purchase) and so on.

Description=Kenny Dalglish was a hugely successful player for Celtic, Liverpool and Scotland, before becoming the first person to win the English league championship while both playing and managing (for Liverpool in 1985, also winning the FA Cup that year). This was his second licensed game, and is a side-scrolling action game featuring single matches played between a team in red and a team in blue, each of which can be any of 9 skill levels. Matches can be varied between 10 and 90 minutes. The ball is loosely controlled in a manner similar to the Kick off series, although it isn’t possible to pass the ball a short distance, so an element of hitting and hoping comes into play, especially as the ball can’t be curved far. The ball bounces quite heavily, and is very difficult to shoot on target from closer than 30 yards or so.

Description=Kick Off was the first football game of its kind, having a top down view and unlike other football games of that time the ball was not glued to the feet of the players. Playing Kick Off requires skills in boll control. There is an option to learn these skills without being harassed by the opposition. The set pieces like corner kicks, passing, sliding tackles and dribbling can be practiced to perfection. Each player on the pitch has a unique combination of 4 attributes, namely Pace, Stamina, Accuracy and Aggression. As you progress you will need to adapt to to different types of players. You can play in a league consisting of 8 teams. The teams in the league are on the whole evenly matched but have different styles of play with players attribute to match that style. There is 12 different referees in the game.

The game now features full tournament modes (although the players on the teams are fictitious) and four different pitches (including an implementation of plastic pitches, whose uneven bounce cause controversy when several British clubs tried them in the 1980s).<br><br>Viewed top-down, the controls involve trapping the ball under your foot, giving you time to prepare passes. Running with the ball is tricky at first, as it doesn't stick to your foot the way it did in contemporary football games. Complex moves such as overhead kicks, back-heels and long-range through-ball passes can be completed with practice.

Like in all such games, your goal on each level is to break all the bricks with a ball, which you bounce with a paddle, and try to save it from falling out of the level. <br><br>Some bricks have a random power-up within them. There are many various power-ups (most beneficial, some of them harmful), such as: lengthening/shortening our paddle, enlarging or duplicating our ball, adding thrusters to the paddle so that it can fly, adding various weapons so that the paddle can shoot and destroy bricks, and many more. <br><br>Occasionally, various monsters will appear on the playfield and begin flying around. Most of those are harmless and do nothing except interfering with the ball (if it hits them, it bounces off). However, some monsters will destroy your paddle if they touch it. <br><br>Each few levels, there comes a special action sequence where you try to defend yourself from a horde of incoming monsters, or defeat a boss by shooting it and avoiding its missiles.

Description=Dizzy must rescue four of his 'Yolkfolk' (groan) chums in this game, from Cuckoo Land, Ice Land, Cloud Land and Zak's Castle.  Like Fast Food it doesn't directly resemble the main series of arcade adventures, instead being a single-screen action game, resembling Pengo. The basic idea is to move around a maze of blocks collecting fruit, but the twist in the style is that you push the blocks in the maze to kill or trap those enemies. After every level is completed a short bonus screen appears where more fruit can be collected. During play various other tokens are released, such as bonus points, a smart bomb and control reversal.

Description=In the mid-'70s, an unusual phenomenon took place: two Americans, Willie Crowther and Don Woods wrote the first text adventure game: it was the Original Adventure and was written in Fortran for a DEC PDP-10 and occupied more than 300 K of memory. It gathered a cult following from the elite programmers who knew how to connect to the data bank where it was located, and like all cults, it had its first "martyrs"; several important programmers were fired after becoming "addicted" to it, found playing it late at night while understood to be working overtime instead.<br><br>In the United States it was the base that inspired Scott Adams to begin with his famous adventures. In Great Britain, Peter Austin, founder of Level 9, the most prestigious English adventure game company, confessed to be impelled by it from his beginnings as a game designer (one of his first adventures was a version of the Original Adventure). In Spain, there was a similar story, since the first Spanish company dedicated exclusively to text adventures (Aventuras AD), made its reputation based on a game curiously called "La Aventura Original" (yes, based on the legendary one), the fruit of 8 months of investigation and work.<br><br>This version, aside from being in Spanish, has with several points worth mentioning, such as having more than 100 detailed locations with graphical illustrations; a special routine of exit descriptions (indispensable for guiding the adventurer through this complex world); and the possibility of using accents, "ñ"'s and opening interrogation and exclamation signs. As well, every object of your inventory is described in text and graphic form. The characters also use the PSI system, so they are not mere objects with human names, but will listen to you and respond -- but most importantly, will act according to how you treat them.

Once all the gold has been collected, a ladder allowing you to move onto the next screen is added. Completing these screens often requires forward planning and precision.<br><br>This was one of the earliest games to include a level editor, allowing the creation of new level designs with no programming skill.

What sets Loom apart from other adventure games (in direct comparison with Sierra's) is its unique interface: you do not carry items around, but rather manipulate existing items through the use of spells. The spells themselves are woven through playing magical notes on a special distaff. Loom also features three difficultly levels, and differentiates them by changing the way the interface works: Standard features the distaff at the bottom of the screen but notes aren't written, whereas Expert doesn't have the distaff and you have to replay the spells by hearing alone.<br><br>In Loom you play the role of Bobbin Threadbare, a young man from the Guild of Weavers who just turned 17. Although you do not know why, you are outcast from the guild and blamed for the lack of prosperity in recent times.<br>After the Council of Elders is attacked and the Elders are turned into swans, you as Bobbin must set forth on a journey to find the swans and try to restore order to the Guild of Weavers.

Description=A puzzle game where the main goal is to make loops! Random pieces are presented over a board, including simple lines and corners as well as S bends and other warped shapes, of varying sizes. It is up to the player to link them up in a loop form, then moving on to the next level. Pieces can be placed on any empty space on the grid, and rotated into one of the four main compass directions.<br><br>Any pieces which are not part of the finished loop when a level is completed are left on the screen, so there is value in playing towards 2 distinct loops, to ensure that you have options depending on which pieces are drawn - unlike Pipe Dream there are no clues as to which pieces are coming next.<br><br>Three play modes are available, two of which can be played with two players. Game A is freestyle - simply make loops, gaining extra points for size and style. <br><br>Game B is about unlocking bonus boards of the game by reaching a certain score. and uses a bonus multiplier method depending on loop difficulty.<br><br>The third mode of play begins with an already made loop and then removes random pieces of it, so the player has to put them back in when they appear again. It is essentially a memory test and logic puzzle of fitting the pieces back as one remembers - although placing a piece where it seems to fit is also often effective.

Description=The heirless King Ardashir I of the Magocratic Kingdom of Persis is falling ill, and before dying intends to name a wizardly successor based on the outcome of a sorcerous tournament to the death.  The main contenders:<br><br>1. Balthazar, the king's seer and master of scrying;<br>2. General Loge, leader of Persis' armies, a War Mage with a focus on flame magic;<br>3. the beguiling enchantress Lilith, queen of neighboring Partha;<br>4. Rhiannon the conjuror, daughter of a druid and barbarian chief, strong in nature spells;<br>5. Uzume, a mysterious summoner;<br><br>and you, an urchin with a handful of cantrips to help survive the streets at night, visiting in hopes of learning a thing or two about magic use by observing the proceedings -- but accidentally, and terrifyingly, thrown into the competition unarmed and outclassed.  To survive, you need to somehow win the competition.<br><br>An unusually MUD-like entry in the 2004 IF Compo (placing 18th), this game pits the player against an array of stronger opponents in an enclosed castle complex, all interacted with through a robust TADS text adventure interface.  Since the emphasis is on survival, not storytelling, descriptions and character interactions are terse and to-the-point -- more Colossal Cave than Zork, with a generous helping of Legend of the Red Dragon mellowing the difference.<br><br>A winning strategy involves thorough exploration of the environment, scavenging arcane knowledge and artifacts from the grimoires of adversaries slain by other competitors, and having the dumb luck to be in the right place at the right time to do so. By the end of the game you should have tamed the denizens of the castle's dungeon, mastered the respective sorcerous schools of all your ex-rivals, brought life to inanimate objects and brought back from the dead extinct monsters to do your bidding -- leaving you in a position for kingship to seem a far more plausible possibility than when you started.  But to get there, you're going to have to tread lightly and do a heckuva lot of hackenslash RPG-style stat-building.

In the second half of the game you can freeze men to save them for the Mother of All Battles.<br> <br>Once you select your island and place for your HQ, you must do some research for better weapons and defences. On the roof of your buildings you can put protectors like archers, gunmen, boiling oil men, and later on even laser turrets. If you send a team of unarmed men into an unoccupied square, they will build an additional base there, with larger armies completing this more quickly.<br><br>Later on higher levels, you'll also build mines and factories, as you'll need to dig a certain material for higher level weapons, depending on whether the area you're on is rich with a certain material or not. With each next level, you'll start from a higher technology level and be able to progress to one higher level up then the at previous level.<br><br>If there is more then just one enemy, you can make an alliance until you crush the other one - three of you can form an alliance against fourth enemy. For what its worth, a certain numeric level of defence is always stronger from the same level of attacker, and men that are not armed (conscripts) can only kill enemy soldiers, not destroy or attack enemy fort.<br><br>The main thing as it always is in strategy games is to be the sole survivor and lead your men to victory, experimenting on vicious technologies, equipping your men, making a perfect soldiers out of them, produce shields, weapons, planes... to dominate the world and crush your opponents. <br><br>You can do the battling only in a certain quadrant, but don't be long as your men will automatically start building the fort, and it will be at the bottom of age level and you'll need to invent everything for that one again.

Rotating barriers, light bulb switches and locked sections must all be taken into account, but there are also magic balloons later on. All this must be done within a time limit, and directing the beam back into itself causes overloads and must be avoided, Tron-style.

Daryl, Alison and Matthew all come in handy, and must be coaxed into doing what you wish. Examining objects often gives few clues, so the detail in the manual is vital, although few of the objects are vastly different from familiar 20th century artifacts. Two levels of object descriptions exist, allowing for faster or more immersive play.

(Mean Ugly Dirty Sports) is a slightly humorous but definitely violent game in which the game itself is won by scoring at least 7 out of 14 goals or by killing enough of the opposing team. Tackles, pummelings, being thrown into the moat -where a shark-like thing will eat you if you don't get out on time- are just some of the things that can happen to your team.<br><br>Ofcourse, there are more ways to win: bribing the opposing team, the referee, or the creature which is used as the ball are worth considering.<br><br>Should your team need a little extra morale, just pick a fight, or buy and sell players on the slave market whenever you like.<br><br>M.U.D.S. vaguely resembles Speedball in the sense that you try to throw the ball in the opponent's goal, but that's where the resemblance ends for me.

Description=Narc is a 1-2 player game, where your mission is to infiltrate the Mr. Big Corporation, the scourge of the underworld. To do this, you must get through the game's eight stages, with over ten sectors like the junkyard, subway, drug lab, nursery, downtown, Sunset Strip, and even the corporation, where Mr. Big resides. In order to get through the stages, you are required to collect a number of safe cards, and insert them in the slot next to the stage exit.  Each sector includes a map, and should be easy to read. For example, the blue or red dots represent you, and the white dots are the missile launchers, while the "E" indicates the exit.<br><br>Your mission ain't going to be easy, as you will come face-to-face with enemies including the canine mutts, Das Lof Gang, Dr. Spike Rush, Joe Rockhead, Kinky Pinky, Sgt. Skyhigh, HQ Posse, and Mr. Big himself. You have two ways you can deal with them: either put a bullet in them or make arrests. Furthermore, they will try to blow you up the minute they see you. Fortunately, you're armed with a shotgun and missile launcher, but these both have a limited supply of ammunition. If your bullet counter reaches one, you can only fire one bullet at a time, so you need to find some more. Also, it is important not to waste all of your missiles: you might need them later when you deal with later enemies like Mr. Big. You are also backed up by a chopper and a mean shiny street machine.<br><br>More often than not, when you blow up enemies, you can pick up several items that they drop, including drugs, money, ammunition, missile launchers, and if you're lucky, safe cards.  Even if you got the safe card and can pass the level, you can keep blowing up enemies to score more points. According to the game, this game is for training purposes only, so you will not get employed by your local DEA office. Is this what the DEA does every day: go on rampages?

Fortunately, during the kidnapping process, Tiki, leader of the tribe, managed to escape the sack, and her job is to rescue Phee-Phee and the other kiwis scattered around New Zealand, and are held in cages in various locations that include Auckland, Rotorua, Waitomo Caves, Strait Cook, and Mt. Cook. <br><br>If Tiki doesn't rescue a kiwi in a limited amount of time, the devil will appear and try to kill her. When Tiki reaches the outskirts of each city, except Strait Cook, there is a boss waiting to meet Tiki, and kill her by using their own choice of weapons. Also making the rescue mission difficult are several nasties that attempt to throw their own weapons, like bombs and arrows, at her. To defeat these enemies, Tiki shoots at them using her crossbow and arrows. More often than not, when Tiki shoots at enemies, they will leave behind pieces of fruit that she can pick up for points. However, it is likely that Tiki may get other weapons or the letters E, X, T, E, N, and D. Collecting all these letters will result in an extra life, and as for the weapons, they include laser shots, bombs, and fireballs. <br><br>In some levels, a few areas are located further up than just left or right, and the only way that Tiki can go up is by snatching something off the enemy that gives her the ability to fly up. Other areas are underwater, and when Tiki goes underwater, her oxygen  meter decreases, so she has to rise up to the surface again to restore her oxygen levels. Apart from her own weapons, Tiki is able to squirt water at enemies if she gets to the top of the water.

Description=Operation Harrier is an action game starring Britain's famous VTOL aircraft. It uses an enhanced version of the Rotoscape system first used in Creative Materials' earlier Rotox: the own plane is seen from the top and when steering left or right the polygonally rendered background rotates around it. A new addition is the ability to change altitude. <br><br>The game consists of several missions, each with a specific goal like destroying an enemy cruiser or power plant or defending an airfield from enemy fighters. Before a mission, the Harrier can be armed with a variety of weapons, including air-to-air and air-to-ground missiles as well as two types of bombs. Standard armament is a forward-firing cannon with unlimited ammunition. A radar screen and a map help finding the enemy during a mission. Fuel is limited, but in some missions in-air refueling is possible. While the Harrier can survive a few hits, it can also be repaired (and refueled) after mission's end. Sometimes it is also possible to make a mid-mission resupply landing at a friendly base.

The authorities have asked the hero from Operation Wolf to rescue the hostages, but only this time, the hero brings his friend along for the ride.<br><br>There are eight missions to complete in Operation Thunderbolt, and each one has you shooting down soldiers, choppers, and tanks. The gameplay varies every one or two missions. In some missions, you are driving a jeep or controlling a boat, while in others, you are walking while you're shooting. You have a limited supply of ammo, and a limited supply of rocket bombs, but you can always stock up by shooting down crates falling from the sky, or by killing a cat or dog that get in the line of fire. Also from crates, you can get special items like bulletproof vests, rocket bombs, and different weapons.<br><br>You also have a life bar to worry about. If you're shot at by soldiers, or if rocket bombs or grenades are thrown at you, you 'll lose energy, and once you're energy is depleted,  you lose one of your three lives. You can lose a lot of energy by killing hostages on purpose,  and you can't easily avoid killing them if you decide to use rocket bombs to wipe out enemies. The eighth mission, the mission that involves you fighting terrorists on a plane,  proves to be difficult because a woman in a blue dress stands up and gets in the line of fire, and you have to very careful when you're going to use rocket bombs.<br><br>There are two endings to this game, and which ending you can watch will depend on the number of hostages you've saved, and whether or not you shot the pilot instead of the mission eight boss.

It can be played with one or two players on the same screen, and the other player can join anytime within the game. <br><br>Your goal is to destroy the balloons which bounce around the playfield.

Apart from balloons, some levels also have barriers that have to be destroyed with your hooks, since they often block your access to balloons. There are also some barriers which cannot ever be destroyed. Your character has the ability to climb ladders, but cannot jump. <br><br>You can also pick up power-ups such as: the ability to fire two shots at once, the hook that attaches to the ceiling and waits 'til something bumps into it, a gun which has a high rate of fire but cannot destroy barriers.

Description=As with all Jeff Minter games, this has a definite distinctive look and feel (although no Llamas or lawnmowers this time). It's a top-down shoot 'em up resembling Sinistar, with the unusual twist of being mouse-controlled, using the left button to fire and the right button to thrust. You can rotate the direction of fire while holding fire down, allowing you to move one way and fire another way (another Minter tradition - witness Llamatron). A Boost function exists to power up your ship, including plutonium pods which unusually can be collected and harvested by the end-of-level enemies as well as your own ship. After the main levels you must steer the ship through a tight tunnel, avoiding contact with the walls.

Description=Pick 'n Pile is a Tetris-style puzzle game. On each level there are a variety of symbols arranged in columns on the screen. By moving the symbols around, you need to create columns which contain identical symbols; once all the symbols in a column are the same, that column disappears. Your goal is to earn points and complete the levels by making all of the symbols on the screen disappear. Occasionally, you may become stuck with a symbol that doesn't match anything onscreen; when this happens, you can call for an additional symbol to drop onto the screen. However, as the symbol which appears is random you may need to create quite a few symbols before the one you need appears. Each level has a time limit in which it needs to be completed; run out of time and you lose a life; lose all lives and the game is over.<br><br>In addition to the regular symbols, there are also some special objects on the screen which may help or hinder your progress. These include bombs which destroy several symbols at once, blocks which may get in the way or be arranged to help out, death heads which diminish time more quickly, and flower pots which can't be moved.

Description=PicrossST is a nonogramme puzzle game for the Atari ST, similar to Nintendo's Picross series.<br><br>The player is presented with a grid, surrounded by numbers on the top and left sides. These numbers represent the number of squares on that row or column that shall be filled. On a 15x15 grid, a number fifteen means that the entire row or column should form a straight line across the grid, whereas the numbers ”10, 3” on the left mean that that row should have one line of 10 filled squares and another shorter line of 3 squares. These lines must have at least one blank square to separate them. Using deduction, it is possible to fill in all the right squares, thereby forming a simple picture.<br><br>The implementation in PicrossST starts out with the program choosing to reveal a row and column at random to help the player out. After that, he is on his own. Using the mouse, squares can either be coloured or marked as presumably empty, a bit like Minesweeper. Marking a blank square as empty is punished with a time deduction, which means that you can trade time for hints.<br><br>Two players may play at once, but in a cooperative manner. The game also comes with a grids editor for constructing puzzles of your own.

Description=PSTAC2k8E is a special tournament edition of PicrossST released on the Atari Convention 2008 in France.<br><br>Like the ”real” PicrossST, it is a ”nonogramme” puzzle where a grid must be filled according to numbers placed on its sides. However, the AC 2008 edition is a test of endurance and fast thinking. All puzzles are random-generated so that it is not possible to solve the puzzle by trying to see a picture in it. Furthermore, it is very unforgiving, with a fast countdown. Time is added to the countdown when the player marks a filled cell in the grid correctly. Controversely, erroneously filling a cell results in a big deduction on the time available. The aim is to get as high a score as possible, rather than just playing for leisure.

Description=Each level of this abstract puzzler challenges the player to set up a network of pipes to allow an unspecified substance known as 'flooz' to flow through as many of those as possible. The pieces are offered in random order, and there are seven different types - straight lines going horizontally or vertically, corners rotating in each of the four directions, and cross-over pieces which carry the flooz straight across horizontally and vertically. Each of these can be entered from either side. When the flooz hits a gap, or a piece which the previous piece can't flow into, the pipe is finished.<br><br>Before the flooz starts flowing from its randomly-selected starting position, the player has several seconds to start placing pieces. They can be put down anywhere. However a situation that can often occur is there will be a long and complex piping arrangement set up, yet a gap somewhere remains to be filled. Players are able to  replace a piece with another in the same square (to make it easier to flow the flooz that way), but for a slight scoring penalty.<br><br>Bonuses are awarded for looping the flooz through both sides of at least 5 cross-over pieces, or passing the flooz through every square on the screen. Later levels have some squares on the grid blocked off, a few gaps in the side-wall (allowing flooz to thread to the other side of the screen). After every four levels there is a bonus game for points, in which the player can only place the pieces in the lowest open space in each column, similarly to the board game of "Connect 4".

And he won't stop until they're all dead... or he is.<br><br>But you don't have to let your people have all the fun; the god's have other tools as well.  You can drown your enemies one at a time with your land lowering powers.  Submerge their towns in swamps. Raise a volcano in the middle of their best farmland.  Even better, you can flood the land and drain all the people who didn't build on high-ground. <br><br>And when you win, you'll have 500 more worlds to conquer.  A god's play is just never done.

It features smooth-scrolling, frantic action, colorful graphics and digital music.<br><br>A total of five goal rooms, arranged in the shape of a cross, are connected with tunnels.

Each player, whether computer-controlled or not, has a room in which his own goal is located (their "defense" zone.) A fourth room -- the Frantic Zone -- contains a goalmouth for each player, while the central room, where action begins, allows access to the four other rooms.<br><br>The object of the game is for each player to protect their own goal while trying to bring the puck/ball into the other players' rooms to score a goal. Bonuses appear randomly in the rooms, allowing the player who passes on them to gain some benefits, such as freezing the other players for a few seconds, gaining extra stamina, or sealing exits.<br><br>The game supports up to 3 player simultaneous quick action single game play, and can support up to 8 players in leagues of varying lengths.  League/tournament play supports player/team management, including training, injuries and position reassignment.

Your boat is fitted with bombs, which can be placed so as to force the other boats to run over them, gaining you points. Extra bombs and fuel litter the course, often close to the banks, which you must avoid contact with, for fear of crashing your boat. When this happens you are forced into the next one, which is, as if by magic, available at a convenient point just beforehand. A helicopter flies overhead, dropping bombs which you must avoid, and often obscuring your view. The other boats often crowd together attempting to force you into the wall.<br><br>As with all the Codemasters budget titles, realism goes out of the window, with an emphasis on simple instantaneous action.

Some bricks explode when you push them, or other brick hits them, and that way they leave the hole, so your brick can continue spining, or yet again, not. Some spin without stop, 'til they hit some other brick that can fall, some replaces the spaces, like building a bridge on that place, some go high and when hit the top, they stick to it, and push, or not, the brick in front of them.

Moving platforms meaning that you need to move a block at a particular time, or in particular order, to prevent them being blockaded. In some situations there are an odd number of a certain type of block - solving these requires positioning two of the blocks one space apart, such that a move will result in a piece making contact with 2 others, and immediately removing all 3. You will also encounter blocks positioned on platforms suspended in space and gaps in level arrangements meaning that a certain number of blocks must be in place to make a certain move possible (by forming a stack, for example)<br><br>The game structure is slightly unusual, as after you complete each batch of four levels you get a choice of 2 sets of levels - you are progressing through an expanding matrix of levels, which means there are 2 sets on level 2, 3 on level 3, 4 on level 4, and so on.

However, his dungeon was soon invaded, and Mervyn was not killed, as he appeared to be a humble frog.<br><br>Viewed from above, the aim is to kill all 96 of the wizards who have invaded the dungeon, which is split into 8 levels, each made up of 16 screens and at least 50 rooms. To see what’s in a room he has to enter it, in a manner similar to the Switchblade games.<br><br>The game’s rather esoteric title comes from the way you obtain spells to upgrade the four different types of power you have (power, offence, defence and effect). When you meet a warlock you enter a mini game in which the letters RANARAMA are in random order, and by swapping pairs of letters in sequence you must form the full word in as little time as possible. This system of having a sub-game for collecting upgrades is similar to the ‘grappling’ concept in Paradroid.<br><br>This earns up to four of the Runes (Mysticism, Witchcraft, Magecraft and Runecraft), each of which can be used on one of the four types of power. The Magecraft offensive use is a fireball, defence for Runecraft makes you invisible to enemies, and the special effect for Witchcraft allows you to jump through space.

You take control of Soviet detective Ivan Danko (played by Schwarzenegger), who travels to Chicago in pursuit of the fearsome Georgian drug lord Victor Rosta. <br><br>The game is essentially a side-scrolling beat'em up in the vein of Vigilante. As Danko, you proceed across four levels which follow the movie's original setting, where you are constantly attacked by members of the Cleanheads, a group of drug-dealers who are in business with Victor Rosta. To eliminate hostiles you can either punch them (slow but long-ranged) or head-butt them (close-ranged but faster). The only defensive move available is crouching, so as to avoid being hit - there is no jumping or any other evasive tactics. Occasionally, you can get hold of a handgun and fire six shots at the villains. Other items you can pick up will boost your health, make you temporarily invulnerable or give you access to bonus levels.<br><br>One peculiarity of Red Heat is its widescreen-like game area, and the fact that all characters are drawn from the waist up. This may find partial explanation in the first level, set in a Russian sauna where, as in the original movie scene, all characters are not wearing clothes.

Description=Revelation is an abstract puzzle game based around cracking codes on safes. Each of the 80-plus levels is a top-down view of an arrangement of locks and dials, which must be aligned so as to unlock each section by having identical colors touching each other. Not all locks can be moved however, and all of this must be done within a time-limit. Your time to collect the gold (by opening each of the 9 doors in sequence in the hope of finding lots of bling) is limited by how long you took to crack the code. There is a bonus game to unlock, as well as extra lives and special power-ups. A password system ensures that a level need only be cleared once.

Description=Rings of Zilfin is an unusual, but relatively unknown early fantasy solo RPG by Ali N. Atabek, who went on to create the Magic Candle series. It was meant for beginners to computer RPGs, featuring no character creation, simple game play and movie-like cut scenes, concentrating more on atmosphere than on character stats.<br><br>The background: Long ago, the Zilfins (mighty wizards) established an enchanted realm of peace and property in Batiniq. They created two rings of power which, worn together, made the wearer invincible. Unfortunately, the evil necromancer Lord Dragos has found one of these rings and has come to great power. The only hope to prevent him finding the second one is Reis, a young boy possessing some innate magical ability. In the introduction, Reis barely escapes Dragos' minions, and leaves his home village. <br><br>After "character creation" (giving Reis an optional other name and selecting one of 10 difficulty levels, which affect your starting resources), you start your quest to find the Zilfins and their second ring and to develop your magical abilities on the way.<br><br>The game features a huge world with over 100 villages and towns in four kingdoms. Each town has up to three buildings you can enter -- shops with items to buy and sell, inns to eat and drink and rest, amongst others --, and also people you can talk to (careful, some are shape shifters!), sometimes offering valuable information. There are also a few dungeons and some caves to explore, but most of the game is played in towns or travelling between them.<br><br>When leaving a location, the game shows a map where you can select the direction off your next target. While travelling between locations, the game shows an interesting side scrolling view. You can set your walking speed, which influences your fatigue, and stop when you encounter pools or plants. Pools can be drunk from (may have positive or negative effects), and the plants can be gathered and eaten later. Some plants have special effects, there are "magic mushrooms" and some other healing and boosting plants. This plant system is one of the things that distinguishes this game.<br><br>While travelling, you may also encounter Lord Dragos' minions, which results in some pseudo-real time combat. The monsters are often quite unusual, like Barvils (mutated bats), Basurs (flying skulls) or Zumagin (the death ray demon). Protected by different armors, you can attack with arrows or swords or by casting spells. The game makes a difference between ground-based and air-bourne monsters -- the latter cannot be attacked with swords, of course.<br><br>The spell system is quite simple. There are three spell levels: Apprentice, Master and Grand Master, each one lets you know more and more powerful spells. Casting a spell always costs some fatigue, and you have to prepare the spell first.<br> <br>The game is highly non-linear and there are several approaches possible. For example, it is possible to make money by trading, buying cheap items in one town and selling them in another town -- which, in fact, is the only way to make money in the beginning. All commands are given by pressing keys, like "G" for getting things or "C" for casting spells. The game may be saved when exiting towns and loaded at the main menu.

All the races take place on the regular road with normal traffic (in both directions) and the cops, as well as occasional oil slicks and stray cows.<br><br>By winning races you can get promoted to a stronger division and earn cash with which you can buy a better bike. Whenever you're knocked off your bike or hit something you will have to run back to your bike and lose valuable time, plus your bike will suffer some damage.

Description=In the 1940s, the Nazis built a base on the moon and plan to use a mysterious substance called Lunarium to reduce people's intelligence. However, in the 21st Century time travel has been mastered, as have jet-propulsion backpacks, plus some cataclysmic weaponry and advanced code-breaking equipment. Thus, you are sent back in time to change the result of the war using this technology to find their five rocket factories and destroy the moon base.<br><br>The game fits the Cinemaware template closely, with a string of action sequences linked by cinematic animation sequences to set the scene. There's also a strategic element, as you move your spies around to gain information and avoid detection, and decide how much Lunarium to use at each stage of the game. Action sequences include hand-to-hand combat with a Nazi guard, and flying through the air shooting either hordes of enemy planes or the Zeppelin itself.

It'll gain speed as it goes, bounce off when it hits obstacles, loose energy when it's caught in traps, die when it falls off the platform. The 32 levels through which you've got to guide the ball are full of traps: laser barriers, ramps, tubes, breakable tiles etc. Colored keys will open doors, switches create (or destroy!) helpful items. These include picks to repair floor tiles, parachutes to prevent you from falling off and bombs to destroy walls. Items have to be bought with coins that are found all over the level. <br>The inertia of the ball has a very realistic feel to it, making the control intuitive and relatively easy. Not so easy, however, is the design of the (huge) levels; to finish Rock 'n Roll, you need skill as well as patience. You got the balls?

The dodgy gear is dirt cheap but you might pay for your choice later on in the game.<br><br>To make your group a star, you have options such as practicing, publicity stunts, and buying gifts for your stars. Each action you choose advances the calendar by one day and you have until December to achieve your ultimate aim of superstardom - represented by a line graph which rises or falls depending on the performance of your band's releases.<br><br>Once your band has recorded their first album you can choose to release the single and/or the album. The single needs a video to go with it which costs varying amounts of cash depending on which director you choose. You can choose to go for publicity, but this can be risky as there is a chance that one of your rock stars will be in the papers as an ex-rock star who died in any of many strange ways (all that's missing is a 'bizarre gardening accident'). Publicity affects your sales directly and also affects the crowds who attend your gigs. You lose the game if either you run out of money, or all of your rock stars die.

As any contact with walls or enemies is deadly, your main task is to avoid that. You may rotate your tank freely and accelerate via an afterburner, thus manoeuvring through the corridors -- imagine a mix of Asteroids and Lunar Lander to get an idea of the physics.<br><br>Scattered throughout the 18 different fortresses are boxes. Shoot these open to find either a) Fuel: this will replenish your supply, which is drained by shooting and accelerating. b) Sun crystals: Collect all to finish the mission. c) Bombs. They will explode in 30 to 60 seconds, destroying your ship. You can avoid that by leaving the screen quickly, or by picking the bomb up; this earns you major credits, but your ship drops much faster due to increased weight. d) Pearls. Collecting these advance the upgrade counter by one to three steps; you may activate the current upgrade at any time, which will improve your rotation speed, engine strength, weapon, shield etc. Boxes are emptied by carefully flying very, very close to them and activating a tractor field.<br><br>As if gravity and accurate flying wasn't challenging enough, the game also confronts you with various enemies. All of these are immobile and fire in a straight line; the sheer mass of them makes avoiding the bullets a difficult task nevertheless. Apart from turrets, there are attractors and repulsors who'll smash you into walls, and force fields that need to be deactivated by finding and shooting a switch.<br><br>The tricky labyrinths together with the short supply of fuel, weight constraints and clever upgrade system make Rotor more a game of tactics and accuracy than arcade action. Wild shooting and careless flying will deplete your fuel in no time; you'll have to progress carefully to discern traps in time.

Description=R-Type is a side scrolling shoot 'em up best known for its extremely tough and strategic gameplay.  You control the R-9 spaceship as it launches a last-ditch effort to repel the evil Bydo empire.<br><br>The R-9 comes equipped as standard with a small gun which can only take down the smallest of enemies without firing several shots. By holding down the fire button, it can be loaded up so as to release a large burst of energy, eliminating all but the strongest enemies in its path. From time to time, pods will come flying in your direction. Upon being shot, they release an upgrade. The first one will invariably be the one called "The Force", which is a weapons pod that clings either to the front or the back of your ship, absorbing any enemy bullets or acting as a bumper with which you can fly head-on into them. You can also use it as an offensive weapon by firing it and pulling it back in. Mastering the Force is vital to surviving in R-Type, since it must be used both as protection against bullet clusters, as a remote controlled cannon, and in order to clear the screen from obstacles. Other upgrades give you target-seeking missiles or a bigger main gun. Different gun types, differentiated by their colour, serve different purposes. The blue one sends laser beams bouncing across the screen (good for tunnels), the red one fires straight ahead, and the yellow one follows any walls it may encounter (good for artillery emplacements).<br><br>The stages of R-Type are made in an organic style, certainly inspired by H. R. Giger's artwork for the Alien movies. When it came out, it was considered trend-setting since it broke off from the stereotypical sci-fi mould of other shoot'em'ups. In part, the levels themselves are your enemy, which is exemplified by the fourth, where spider-like creatures weave webs that cover the screen and block your path, or levels with intricate tunnel systems. Still, the levels are best handled with a combination of strategy and reflexes, without the memorisation that is required of R-Type's contemporary rival, Gradius.

Description=RVF Honda puts you on board a realistically-modeled RC30 bike, with the task of becoming world champion. Initially you race at Clubman level on fictitious local tracks (one of which is set in MicroProse's old UK home of Tetbury), before moving up to UK and then World championship racing if you're good enough.<br><br>Each class of racing has 8 computer opponents, with the top 7 finishers in each of the championship's 8 races scoring points, and the races can be set to 5,10, 15 or 20 laps. The game's graphics appear to feature sprite-based bikes atop polygon scenery, which makes for very fast gameplay. <br><br>The circuits feature puddles of water to upset the bike's handling, and oil, which causes you to crash. It takes time to remount the bike and get back up to speed by revving it back up (more realistic than most motorbike games at the time, but frustrating as you suffer for mistakes more), and after a couple of crashes the bike's dashboard fails, making it much harder to ride competitively.<br><br>There is a two-player null-modem link-up mode, which can support an ST racing against an Amiga if you have the right cable.

In this turn-based strategic simulation you must choose a team of four of these from the 8 available, and take them to victory in five increasingly tough missions. Even before you get into the main gameplay, there is a lot of strategy involved in choosing weaponry, as they make different amounts of noise when used (reducing the stealth potential) and their ammunition is of varying weight.<br><br>In each turn you have limited action points per soldier, which must be used for all movement, firing and reloading moves. The maps are viewed isometrically, with a compass used to indicate the directions of movement, and where the incoming fire emanated from.

To the left of these stadiums is a green bar, and the higher the green bar, the greater the distance the ball will go. <br><br>Depending on where the ball lands, the player has to answer three types of questions from one of four question packs. Home questions (worth one point) are generally related to modern football and are the easiest to answer. Away questions (worth two points) are generally related to football in the 1960s and '70s with teasers about 'golden oldies'. Finally, derby questions (worth three points) will test your knowledge of football trivia, and these questions are fun as well as factual. Players can choose to answer the question or pass onto the next player. If the player chooses to answer a question correctly, a penalty shootout is given which involves the player kicking a goal to score bonus points.<br><br>The winner of the game is declared after all players have completed 21 or 42 matches (when one league season is completed). The winner is the player who has the most points.

Description=An intermediary step in complexity between the brutally basic HAMURABI and more sophisticated modern titles such as Civilization, Santa Paravia and Fiumaccio ushers you into a Merchant Prince setting, governing over a 15th-century Italian city-state, competing with the savage forces of nature and against up to 5 (7 in some later versions) other players in the hot-seat, seeing who can rise through the ranks to claim titles from COUNT, to MARQUIS, GRAND DUKE (and, finally, H.R.H. KING.)<br><br>At its heart the game is, as are its predecessors, about bean-counting -- weighing your current reserves of grain (measured in steres) against your population's food demands, wondering how many gold florins the market price for your surplus will net, and how many hectares of land that'll permit you to purchase... and whether that investment will come back to haunt you the following turn if the weather shifts from feast to famine, when you have plenty of dirt and nothing growing in it to feed your grumbling populace.  However, the game cleans up real nice, and cute graphical depictions may help you to forget that your debauched Renaissance rule largely consists of moving debits and credits back and forth across a virtual ledger.<br><br>Varying difficulty levels help you find your own comfort zone in which to engage bad harvest conditions, worse real-estate prices and, worst of all, the endless appetites of what must amount to hundreds of thousands of rats, endlessly nibbling at your reserves.  Surplus capital can be sunk into blue-chip investments such as marketplaces and mills, palaces, cathedrals and private armies.  If, after commissioning them all, you find you don't have so much surplus capital after all, you can always cook the books by adjusting several different flavours of taxes, tariffs and customs fees... but tamper too much and your local economy will be stifled!<br><br>Nearly every downturn in this game has an equal and opposite check, or at least a balance, to keep it from demolishing your estate in a single swoop... however, early versions of this game, as with many titles of its era, may cruelly and arbitrarily cut your rule short with a random death.  All the more reason to carpe diem and do the best with what you've got, while you've got it.

At the highest vantage point stands The Sentinel,  a statue-like being with an energy draining stare,  you begin at the lowest.  "Energy" plays an important role,  there's a constant amount in the game world and each object is worth a certain number of units - including you.<br><br>The object of each level is to absorb The Sentinel and Hyperspace to the next from his vantage point. <br><br>The Sentinel scans further round the landscape every few seconds - if you're caught in his gaze,  or rather the square you are standing on can be seen,  you'll have about 5 seconds to teleport to another location (or hit a key to teleport to a random location - which will never be higher,  and may be lower than your current level) before the Sentinel begins absorbing your energy,  when it reaches zero you will be destroyed. To travel a "robot hull" must be created on a visible square then teleported to,  making sure you absorb your old hull to avoid losing energy. Boulders and trees can also be created,  trees to block The Sentinels view and boulders can be stacked to gain higher ground. <br><br>There are a few other elements to the game - on later levels there will be other Sentries positioned around the landscape. If only part of you can be seen i.e. not the square you are standing on, a nearby tree can be changed into a "Meanie"  which will ultimately force you to teleport. There are 9999 levels in the game but the next level number is based on the current level + how much energy you have remaining.<br><br>Sentinel Returns is a remake very true to the original.

The player has to navigate through several areas filled with enemies and traps, collecting keys and activating triggers than open new areas or give Aarbron the means to overcome a sub-boss. The number of moves the player has at disposal is limited: duck, jump and only two attacks: punch and a flying kick. While most enemies die with just one hit, the player must time each attack accurately. However, there are also traps of objects that cannot be destroyed, and these require the player to jump, duck or move according the sequence. The player has only one life with 12 hit points that can be replenished by collecting some objects hidden in the level (like an off-route location or a under a megalith), which also contributes to the difficulty level.

Description=Civilization has the widest scope of any strategy game of its time. You are a leader of a nation. You begin in the Stone Age, and complete the game in the XXIth century (unless your civilization gets destroyed earlier). Your eventual goal is to become the dominant civilization in the world, either by wiping out everybody else, or being the first to get a space ship to Alpha Centauri.<br><br>As the nation's leader, you have many responsibilities. You have to build cities, and then micromanage them, constructing various buildings. Most of people in your cities will be working on the neighbouring lands to get food (without it, your city won't survive or grow), production (used to build military units and buildings) and trade (which can be exchanged for money, science (see below) or luxuries that make people happy. You decide how much trade you want to invest into each of these areas.) You have to make sure that your people are in a good mood; if they get too unhappy, the city will collapse into disorder, and won't produce anything until you fix the situation. <br><br>If you're ambitious, you can build Wonders of the World - epic constructions, such as the Pyramids or the Hoover Dam. Each Wonder is an unique thing, and only one of each can exist in the world. They give you a lot of benefits if you complete them, but they take a long time to build, and many of them will eventually stop working. <br><br>There are other nations in the world, and there are also barbarians, so you'll have to invest into the military to protect yourself and to attack. Sure, you can sign peace treaties with other nations, and even exchange scientific knowledge with them (although sometimes they'll demand tribute from you), but eventually you'll probably have to fight. You control each of your military units on the world map, attacking your opponents' units and cities (possibly taking over them). <br><br>Not all units are for combat though. Settlers are used to build cities, create roads (for easier travel of your units) and improve the land around cities, increasing production. Diplomats can be sent to foreign cities to negotiate with the other nations or create embassies, but they can also bribe enemy units to join you and conduct espionage and sabotage in the enemies' cities. Caravans can be sent to faraway cities to increase trade in their home city, and they can also help in building Wonders of the World. <br><br>Scientific progress is an important part of the game. The more science your cities produce, the faster you research new technologies. Initially, you'll be finding out about the wonders of Alphabet or Bronze Working, but late in the game you'll be researching Computers and Robotics. Most technologies give you some new units, buildings and other things, although some have more interesting effects - for example, after inventing the Automobile, you'll find out that your citizens started producing pollution. Pollution is a bad thing; if there's too much of it, global warming may occur. <br><br>How your cities prosper depends partially on the type of government that your nation has. Initially you're living in Despotism, but this can stunt growth of your civilization, so it's a good idea to switch to something else - Monarchy, Republic, Democracy or Communism.

Build different sizes of stations to take care of different local needs, create trains that switch consists at different stations and maximize throughput. Upgrade/retire/modify trains as times change. The faster the trains arrive, the more money they earn. Multiple options will keep you busy as each game is different.

Description=This game is actually a compilation of smaller games belonging to different genres. Krusty the clown appears in the beginning of the game and presents a menu with five games to play (one of which is not available from the start): A jump-and-run game, where Bart must find an exit on a ship, while enemies fire at him and try to prevent him from reaching the exit; a card game, where you have five tries to find hidden cards on a board; a simple jigsaw puzzle; a series of trivia questions concerning the Simpsons; and finally, a platform-skateboard game (available only after you have completed the ship level). Needless to say all games are connected to the famous TV series "The Simpsons".

Description=Sorcerer Lord is a medieval fantasy game of tactical warfare.<br><br>The evil Shadowlord's army is threatening to overrun the peaceful country of Galanor. The alliance of races in Galanor isn't very fond of suppression, slavery or extinction, so they are preparing for war -- it's your job to coordinate the Galanorian defense.<br><br>Movement and combat are turn-based. You and the Shadowlord alternately recruit new troops, move armies on a 2D hex-map of the land and try to conquer the enemies garrisons. The outcome of fights is shown as plain text only. Although the gameplay is quite simple, there are a few tactical knacks like certain races fighting more fiercely in certain terrain types, fatigue levels and basic statistics for army leaders. Despite the game's title, magic is a rather unimportant element of chance in battles and not under your direct control.<br><br>The game contains a time limit; you've got 40 turns in easy level, less in advanced levels.

Description=Solomon's Key is a clear conceptual influence for this action puzzler. Our hero must guide a ball through a level to the spot marked 'In', by creating and removing blocks to alter its path. The game is prevented from being a pure clone due to the ball, which moves automatically once activated, and can be controlled by using strategically-placed blocks.<br><br>Simply reaching the ball usually involves modifying the level layout using these bricks. There are enemies moving on fixed paths which must be avoided, and bonus items to collect. Also watch for bonuses such as invincibility, gravity-alteration and teleporting. You take time to rotate, so the controls aren't truly immediate. The ball takes 20 seconds to start moving, so use this time to plan ahead.

Description=In Spidertronic the player gets to take control of a robotic spider moving through a world of isometric levels. Each level consists of tiles that make out the spider's web. Problem is that the web is under siege by odd spherical creatures. This has lead to some passageways being broken and now it's up to our little spider to repair the damage done. The aim then is to rebuild these parts of each level so that the spider can move on to the next. This is done with the use of coloured tiles. The HUD shows a flashing dot that indicates what colour is needed. The spider then has to find a tile in that colour and move it to the tile that needs to be repaired. Once this is all done the spider gets access to a teleporter and can move on to the next level. The spider isn't alone however. It has to be careful not to come into contact with the balls that move around the web. Balls can be destroyed by building a web in front of them. They won't be gone for long though since they will respawn after just a few seconds.

Spike must rescue his friends from the mysterious castle, but first he has to escape from the (apparently friendly) villager's house where he finds himself, as the door won't open.<br><br>The game is a mix of puzzles and action.  The action involves you dodging various enemies, such as dogs, ghosts, bats, etc, and avoiding the many traps in the dungeons of the castle.<br><br>You only have a limited amount of energy, and if you lose all of it by touching enemies or traps, you lose a life.  If you lose all your lives you lose the game.<br><br>The puzzles, which are mostly fairly simple, involve both the use of objects, such as money to bribe a guard, and switches that perform various functions, such as deactivating traps.  <br><br>Keys are very important, as they are needed to unlock your shipmates' cells.  Some cells are protected by guards, who must be tempted away somehow to get to the cells they are guarding.

The game is broken into a number of episodes, which carry the overall plot of trying to restore Arthur's kingdom to some semblance of what it once was. Early episodes involve gathering the Knights of the Round Table, who have broken their fellowship. Because of their general distrust and dislike of certain other members, many knights will only return if asked by certain people and/or are given the correct incentive. Ultimately, you will wage a war on the sons of Mordred, who vie for the same throne their father did and stop the machinations of Morgan LeFay<br><br>The game is played on two different levels. The first is a real time map where groups move about from place to place. At any time (or when a group encounters another or a place of importance) you can switch to a 'scene' level, which is a side-view of the group currently highlighted. Here you can pick up, drop, and manipulate quest items.

Description=Star Command is a quite unknown sci-fi role-playing game by SSI, designed by Phantasie designer Winston Douglas Wood. It features a huge universe to be discovered, detailed character generation and development, a mass of items, some exotic aliens and tactical space and squad-level combat, similar to SSI's Pool of Radiance released the same year and other games of the Gold Box series. The game has nothing to do with Star Command Deluxe or Star Command: Revolution.<br><br>The game plays in a distant future. Earth is a distant memory, having been destroyed long ago. The small human population is concentrated in a small portion of the galaxy, called "The Triangle" due to its form, and threatened from its neighbors: The Alpha border is plagued by pirates, recently united under a certain "Blackbeard", the Beta border is frequently ambushed by an intelligent insect-like alien race who is thought to plan an all-out war. The third border leads to largely unknown territory with space-faring robots of unclear origin. The only hope for mankind is the Star Command, the headquarter of military forces. You control a spaceship crew, trying to secure peace by completing missions issued by Star Command.<br><br>Game starts at Startport Luna, where you first will have to assemble and equip your crew and buy a starship before rushing out saving humanity.<br><br>Assembling the crew, i.e. character generation, is quite detailed and done by first recruiting and then training characters. Each character has seven basic stats like Strength and Intelligence. If the stats look okay, you select one of four classes (Pilots for flying ships and communicating with aliens, Marines for espionage, Soldiers for fighting, and finally Espers with strange psi powers). The character now has to be trained for eight years; each year, you select a skill to be trained, and, if you're lucky, the character increases his skill -- he may also learn nothing. Skills can be trained more than once, increasing the effective skill level. All in all, there are 18 skills, with a different set available for each class. Some trainings does not improve skills, but basic stats -- Special Forces, for example, increases speed and accuracy.<br><br>Character usually start out as Privates, but they the rank can be increased by going to Officer's school. There are 13 ranks up to Grand Admiral, with increasing pay -- money is sparse, so this may be a good choice. Then again, it may be not. Later in the game, with enough funds, you can create clones of your character to replace him when he dies. Character also age during play.<br><br>After you have created your crew, it's time to spend your money. First of all, you need a spaceship -- there are nine different ships, with different attributes like armor or fuel capacity. The ship may be upgraded by several systems, including from engines, guns, shields, drop ships, computers, etc. Finally, you have to equip your crew, again choosing among a vast selection of armor, weapons and miscellaneous items. Having a fully equipped crew at your disposal, you're now ready to get some mission from the Space Command and launch your ship!<br><br>While in space, you are shown a view of the environment, with commands at the bottom and the crew or ship status on the right. The galaxy is quite big, consisting of 32x32 sectors, each containing several systems, with each one having up to 10 planets. You can select the view, changing from Galaxy Scan (showing the whole galaxy) to Long Range Scan (showing 8x8 sectors) to Sector Scan (all systems and starports of a sector) to System Scan (the star and its planets) to Visual Scan (direct view of a planet, starport or space station with its statistics).<br><br>While travelling through space, you may encounter ships. The game then switches to turn-based tactical combat -- but that may include peaceful interaction. In each turn, you first have a selection of communication strategies -- bargain, plead, ask, demand, even impersonate a deity are possible. Then you can move and rotate your ship, and finally, you can fire.<br><br>Some situations, for example when you're boarding an enemy ship or while travelling on land, you can engage in squad combat, which closely resembles spaceship combat, but is influenced gravity, atmosphere and terrain.<br><br>One some missions, you will have to explore underground complexes, which may contains traps and other specials events.<br><br>There are 17 missions all in all, but they have no time limit, so you can do other things -- and you should, like trying to get some cash. Additionally, some missions are randomly generated, so each game differs somewhat. Character get training after each completed mission, but they can also pay for it, which is very expensive.<br><br>All in all, the game play is simple to learn, but quite complex and addictive despite the crude graphics and nearly non-existent sound, as the game emphasizes on character development and atmosphere.

Each quadrant is represented by numbers, where each number refers to: Stars, Starbases and number of enemy ships. Your starship is also equipped with long-ranged sensors to view adjacent quadrants an well as short-ranged sensors to view your current surroundings.

Zaldron starships are unique as they have the ability to cloak (invisible on the both map screens). Zaldrons also use phasers as their main weapon.<br><br>This type of combat consists of either eliminating all hostiles in the present quadrant (by destroying the enemy ships) or by capturing those ships (and optionally delivering them to a starbase). Your main arsenal consist of Phaser, Torpedoes and Mines. Torpedoes are reserved for direct destruction of enemy vessels. Phasers are usually reserved for the intent of disabling an enemy vessel for capturing purposes. Mines are used to damage enemy vessels that have the bad habit of moving around when eluding your torpedoes.<br><br>Capturing enemy vessels may only be conducted when the enemy vessel is disabled (by phasers or other means). Space Marines then must board the adjacent ship and automatic combat occurs between your space marines and the enemy crew. If successful, the enemy ship will be captured as well as some power reserves and enemy prisoners.

Description=The Planet Novenia has been attacked by the Egrons, who snuck in by disguising their craft as the protected Starglider species, which Novenia's automated defenses were programmed not to shoot. <br><br>Your task is to fight them off using only an obsolete Airborne Ground Attack Vehicle. This was designed as the ultimate combat machine, with sophisticated hardware up to Draziw Yarg's high standards. It has a fully-rechargeable shield, plasma drive unit, an inbuilt scanner and 10,000-sector map, a top speed of 2550 Urads and two homing missiles.<br><br>The game is viewed from within AGAV's cockpit, with control over speed, weapon targeting and firing. There are several control options to decide exactly how the craft works, with fixed or floating sighting, and the option of automatic centering, allowing you to balance the game between easy sighting and advanced shooting ranges.<br><br>Repair depots must be visited frequently, as they can refill the weapon bays as well as repairing the ship. Crucially, the Egron Stargliders need 3 missiles to shoot down, so at least 1 visit to a depot is required to complete this job, at which point you move up to the next, harder, level.

Description=The Star Portal is a text adventure created with AGT.<br><br>The earth is recovering from a time of unrest and the exploration of the solar system has halted. You are the adventuring type, the one that goes of to exotic places and searches for treasures. While having a drink in one of the local pubs, you got into a conversation with a fellow who had obviously been drinking too much. During the conversation he made several references to a secret installation on Mars, and the alien artifact within it. After that night you spent six month and most of your money to track down the truth to this rumor. You found a member of the third martian expedition, the expedition that found the artifact, who tells you the story about it. It looks like a large vid-phone booth, but with a single lever inside it instead of a phone. It turns out that this seems to be a sort of teleporter, sending things to random, far of locations. Some locations are so far away that it takes radio waves five or eight years to reach the earth. The WorldGow got scared and suppressed the story and a guarded building was constructed around the artifact.<br><br>You set of to mars aboard a supply ship for the only guard at the installation. The ship did not land at the artifact and most of your equipment was lost during a sand storm. You are now in the middle of the martian desert and you have to find your way to the installation and see what you can do with the artifact.

Description=As the pilot of an interstellar starship, your mission is to destroy all of the Krylon fighters which are closing in on your starbases! There are three different types of fighters roaming throughout the galaxy; cruisers, fighters, and basestars. With the help of your galactic map, you can find the sectors of the galaxy where these fighters are located and then warp there to destroy them. When all of the fighters in a sector are destroyed, you can warp to a new location for the next battle. Be sure to keep an eye on your starships energy; warping to new locations, being hit by enemy fire, or colliding with an asteroid will drain your energy. If you completely run out of energy, your starship will be destroyed, however you can warp back to a starbase to refuel at any time. Returning to a starbase will also repair other types of damage your starship can receive, such as faulty engines, loss of your shield, and faulty photon torpedoes. When all of the Krylon that are visible on your galactic map have been destroyed, you win this round and can advance in rank (or even be demoted if you performed poorly on a mission).  The games difficulty will gradually increase as you rise in rank from ships cook up to captain.

Description=(From Infocom Home Page site)<br><br>After the fall of the Second Galactic Union in 1716 GY, a ten-thousand-year dark age settled upon the galaxy. Interstellar travel was nonexistent, and many star systems descended into a near-barbaric state, buring coal and gas for energy, and growing food directly from exposed topsoil. In 11,203 GY, a treaty between the Empires of Tremain and Galium formed the Third Galactic Union. Ships of the Stellar Patrol (a pseudo-military wing of the Union government on Tremain) began exploring the galaxy, searching for the human civilizations that are the remnants of the Second Galactic Union. You are a native of the planet Gallium, one of the most politically powerful but culturally barren worlds in the Union. Your great-great-grandfather was a founding officer of the Stellar Patrol, and for five generations, your family has served in the Patrol. It was always taken for granted that you would sign up as soon as you came of age. Once in the Patrol, you discovered that the exciting career promised in all the Patrol recruitment brochures was nonsense. Your life was drudgery and demerits. The one time you got to see an exotic planet was right after a big parade, when they needed a detail to sweep up all the confetti. Then came your big moment: shipwrecked on a seemingly deserted world, you met an exuberant robotic companion named Floyd. Together, the two of you discovered the secret of that mysterious planet, Resida, and saved it from near destruction. As a result of your heroics, you were offered, and quickly accepted, a juicy promotion. Good-bye Ensign Seventh Class -- hello Lieutenant First Class! No more scrubwork! No more bathroom details! No more cleaning groth cages! Finally, your life in the Stellar Patrol would be as exciting as those brochures had promised! Oh, how naive you'd been. Your daily routine simply replaced tedious scrubwork with tedious paperwork. Since your planetfall on Resida, five long years have dragged by, without a single event worthy of note. Why, just look at today's "thrilling" assignment: scooting over to Space Station Gamma Delta Gamma 777-G 59/59 Sector Alpha-Mu-79 to pick up a supply of Request for Stellar Patrol Issue Regulation Black Form Binders Request Form Forms...

Description=The board game Stratego is a more elaborate version of Capture the Flag. Each player starts with 40 pieces; made up by the flag, 5 bombs, and an assortment of 9 types of military units. <br><br>After these have been placed, each player takes it in turn to move their pieces. Other than scouts (which are the least powerful) the units can only move one space at a time.The flag and bombs can't be moved during the game, so watch out for any squares the computer does not move when it otherwise logically should, and these could be your goal.<br><br>When you choose a square occupied by an opposition piece, combat arises, and the higher-numbered piece is lost from the game. You have no way of knowing what strength the opposition pieces are until you have hit them. <br><br>This computerized interpretation has 3 different board layouts, a selection of automatic setups with different strategic benefits, and a demo mode.

Description=Strike Aces is a flight simulator designed to give players a feel for the quick decision-making process that real pilots need to fly. It takes place at the Strategic Air Command Bombing and Navigation Competition, a real-life event that occurs every year at Ellsworth Air Force Base in South Dakota. The best aircrews from around the world and some of the best aircraft come to participate in a series of three missions that are constantly monitored, with points awarded to aircrews in various categories. In the end, the aircrew that has gained the post points receives the Curtis E. LeMay trophy. In this game, you are the pilot of one of these aircrews with a choice of flying one of six aircraft, and your missions will pit you against any of seven additional enemy aircraft (although you will not get to fly them). To practice flying, you can do a Free Flight; when you're ready to compete, you will get to complete a series of 16 missions. You can also design your own missions, if you like.

There are 3 skill levels, as well as two practice modes - one for the rudiments of flight and the other for combat. The action-centered nature of the title means that it can be seen as an advanced shoot 'em up rather than a pukka flight simulator.<br><br>Acquiring a lock on enemy planes and tanks is made easier by the advanced targeting technology of the planes, and escaping enemy fire is aided by the vectored thrust system. Shooting out the tanks clears ground space to set up your own bases, which must then be defended. VTOL (vertical take-off and landing) is correctly implemented, although more traditional horizontal take-offs should be used when space permits. The full range of weapons are provided; experience will tell you which to use in which situations, based on enemy volume and range.

Runner, completing each course before time runs out.<br><br>There are also enemies on each course, such as cycles, indestructible armored drones, and flying bird-like craft.  Shoot or avoid them.  If you hit them, you lose one of your shields (your craft has six total) and are slowed down temporarily.  The more shields you have at the finish line, the more bonus points you get.  Getting hit with no shields does not kill you, however.  There are no lives in this game.  The only way to lose is to fail to cross the finish line.<br><br>Along the way you'll encounter Boost Pads that temporarily speed you up to incredible speeds and make you indestructible.  By running over enough green stars on each course, you can also earn Shockwaves, which destroy all enemies in your path.<br><br>Note that there is no accelerator in this game.  Your craft always goes full speed, unless you hit something.  Then you will slow down, but quickly accelerate back to full speed.  Other than that, you cannot slow down and the only way to speed up is to run over a Boost Pad.  Your only controls are steering left and right and aiming the gun on top of your craft up and down.

It's effectively a turn-based strategy game of sorts, as each player has 30 seconds to make their move (within a 30 minute match length), which involves first selecting a player, then aiming the direction in which he will be flicked, then the power and swerve of the flick are determined by the length of time the button is held down for. <br><br>With any luck, your player will hit the ball, and hit it such that it doesn't leave the playing area, and doesn't hit an opponent. If any of those rules are violated, possession passes to the opposition. Before each flick, the team not in possession can make a 'defensive flick' involving moving one of their players into a potential blocking position (without hitting the ball or an opponent, as this is a foul).

As before, the racing is overhead view and against a field of 9 computer cars, with championship points awarded for finishing positions. The computer drivers now take on the humourous names from Lotus 1, such as 'Ayrton Sendup' and 'T Hairy Bootson'. The most noticeable addition is a split screen 2 player mode. <br><br>The power ups have been changed around from the original, with the handling improvements gone, so as to put more of an emphasis on learning to control the slippery cars. These have been replaced by further weapons and more engine upgrades.<br><br>The questions from the original have been replaced by mock driving test questions about stopping distances and the like - as before, money and points are won and lost depending on your answers.

You play a witch (although the character looks decidedly masculine, for no apparent reason), and have to negotiate four worlds, each split into bite-size chunks. <br><br>The levels are populated with bats, trolls and snakes, which have programmed attack patterns and follow you off the screen. You can collect and cast up to 12 spells, which are accessed using the cursor or function keys (the manual amusingly refers to Amigas having F11 and F12 keys, which they don't). These include upgraded weapons (the default one isn't especially powerful), and help such as magic staircases and a metal melter. Some sections of water kill you, other identical ones take you to different sections.

Description=SuperFly is an extremely, extremely simple game. Or at least its controls are. Your task is to fly a vehicle at a steady pace through a scrolling cave system, with your only method of input being a single button. Press the button to give your vessel lift, release it and gravity will do its work. At all times, you must avoid crashing into the top and bottom of the cave, and avoid the obstacles which appear a screen apart. It is all rather similar to Dragonwing.<br><br>To spice things up, SuperFly has everything a modern game must have (save for complex controls and 3D graphics). It has different game modes, different vessels, a system of experience points to lock up new areas and modes, a picture gallery, a jukebox and even a gamma setting.<br><br>As you start out the game with zero experience, you can only "fly" your submarine in the most basic game mode, Freeflight. Here, you only fly on for as long as you can handle, amassing points until you luck up the next mode; Starsearch. Now, your object is to pick up a specified number of stars while flying through the caves. After that comes the Stage mode, which is like Freeflight, only you fly towards a goal, which is farther and farther removed the more stages you complete. The Hunter mode is like Freeflight but with stars added, but here the goal is to simply collect as many as possible instead of a set number.<br><br>The final mode to be unlocked is the Story mode. Through introductory pictures between the stages, it tells the story of our hero, Dr. James Snuggles who must go all the way to the moon to save his girlfriend Kylie. You start out in your submarine as usual, until you reach your helicopter. Fly the helicopter between the clouds, and you might reach the spaceship. After that, you put on jetboots and fly like Superman to save Kylie. All these vessels (and boots) are eventually locked up for use in all modes.

You start off managing Folkford United, the worst team in the country, with players including Brian Evans, Nicky Moody and Bruce Roberts, and rival teams include Oldcastle, Marwick and Stoke Berry.<br><br>The second difference is the lack of statistics for player details. Instead, sentences such as 'best in defence, can also play in midfield. Has been playing reasonably well. Signed for £100,000 from Oldcastle 2 years ago. Current value around £150,000' are used, and its through playing matches and noting player ratings that you interpret how good a defender he is.<br><br>Another break with convention is an attempt at a human side, with players and fans communicating with you, offering advice, praise or semi-literate criticism.<br><br>The training feature is more complex than usual, requiring you to select 3 activities (from a selection such as passing, gym work and lap running) for each player each week - players will complain if they feel your selections are boring or unhelpful.<br><br>If you own either Emlyn Hughes' International Soccer (for the standard versions) or Wembley International Soccer (for the Amiga 1200 version) you can play around 1 match in 6, and watch all the others - otherwise you simply see a progressive score update, and can intervene with substitutions or tactical changes.

The oranges can be upgraded to lemons and finally the lemons upgraded to pineapples. Hidden under the field is a letter (in the shape of a coin), which can be used for the "EXTRA" at the top of the screen.

It's a football management game, setting you in charge of one of the teams in the top 2 English divisions of the time and giving you control over transfers, tactics and training regimes as you aim to guide your team to success. Initially you can only manage the lower teams, but if you succeed over a few seasons you will become respected enough to have a chance to get the top roles.<br><br>The focus is on ultra-realism, which makes it very hard to quickly transform a club's fortunes, as there is a lack of money at many of the smaller teams and attracting players is harder than in the Premier Manager series and similar. Matches are viewed from top-down highlights, with 3 levels of detail (goals-only, highlights and kick-by-kick) offered.

Description=Talespin is an adventure game creation system made by Mark Heaton and his family (wife and their five children), which allows you to create interactive graphic- and text-oriented adventure games, demos, books, tutorials, or whatever application you can think of. It offers graphics, 100 development commands, mouse control, no copy protection, hard drive support, and Telltale, a run-only module that allows users without Talespin to see your work.<br><br>Talespin also includes two sample adventure games: The Grail made by 19-year-old Rudyard Heaton and The Wolf made by another artist<br><br>The design idea that drives Talespin is a "page" built from drawings, text, and sound. Conditions and variables control the text, graphic, and action/solution possibilities, and all pages are linked to form a complete story sequence. The Chain To Title At Page option lets you connect one story to another, linking new or continuing tales across more than one disk.<br><br>The paint/drawing program offers Pencil, Spray, Mini-Spray, Block, Blob, Line, and Fill functions. The Lens option allows magnification of a screen area for detailed work; Undo removes the most recent drawing action. Although Talesplin can handle 512 colors, the ST can display only 16 at a time (due to a hardware limitation); therefore, all drawings on a page must use the same palette. Pictures can be copied from other stories as well as sounds.<br><br>Variables let you control the flow of text entries and drawings. Variables must be defined (CONVERSATION, for example), set to a level, and given conditions that will determine further text actions or movement to different pages. The proper setting of variables, their values, and their conditions provides for more than one action or solution for a given puzzle or problem.<br><br>All the menu selections are controlled with the mouse: the pointer highlights, the left button selects. Clicking the right button brings up the dvelopment menu. The only oddity about Talespin concerns text. Clicking a character's head brings up a bubble, within which will appear the currently available choices. The mouse pointer is used to highlight either question; the left button selects it; the program will then take the appropriate action.

The British side wins by simply surviving for a certain time or by destroying enough German aircraft. The German side wins by destroying enough RAF fighters, either in the air or on the ground.<br><br>Also included in the game is a mission builder for designing custom missions, and a film playback option for reviewing recorded flight footage.

Description=Time Bandit is a Gauntlet-style arcade game with text adventure elements.<br><br>Having nothing to do with the Terry Gilliam movie Time Bandits, this game utilises the time-travel theme for a fast-paced variation on the good old Gauntlet concept. Your bandit visits 16 different worlds throughout time to grab as much loot as possible and, in the long run, do some universe-saving stuff as well.<br><br>Each of the 16 locations -- featuring such varied places like a medieval arena, a bomb factory, a wrecked spaceship and a ghost town -- is basically a labyrinth filled with treasure and -- you guessed it -- monsters. You've got to dodge these or blast them with your weapon, while collecting keys, opening doors and searching for the exit. Although theoretically each location consists of 16 sub-levels, these are merely the basic layout flipped or mirrored, some items redistributed and the monster speed increased. After completing a level, you return to the world map, where you may freely choose the next challenge (nice) and save your game (very nice).<br><br>Interestingly, Time Bandit tries to spice up the fast arcade action with text adventure scenes. Due to this strange mixture, you will occasionally bump into persons or computer consoles with which interaction is possible. For example, you've got to explore and repair the damaged spaceship Excalibur. However, the parser is crude at best; you'll have to know exactly what to do, or else you will trigger no reaction. <br><br>Gaming veterans will discover a score of elements of and allusions to arcade classics, such as Gauntlet (obviously), Pac-Man, Centipede, Bomberman, and others.

You can play either single matches or a full league competition. Tip Off can be played by four players simultaneously, so can play co-op with a friend against the computer, or just compete against one or two other players.

Description=Titan is a 2D arcade game / puzzle game hybrid.<br><br>For some reason, mad professors of the future tend to invent strange entertainment games in which every participant dies. Professor Hybrys’ variant is called Titan and involves a ball, a control unit and 80 labyrinths. Your objective is either to destroy all destructible blocks in each level by hitting them with the sphere, or to pilot it to the exit. The black ball is beyond your control; it will bounce straight or diagonally through the labyrinth with constant speed. You move the control unit, a small box, with you are to position in a way that the ball bounces off it in the desired direction. You can also catch the sphere by quickly moving over it, and then release it in a direction of your choice.<br><br>The labyrinths not only contain harmless, destructible blocks, but also increasingly difficult hazards. If the sphere or your control unit hit a skull symbol, one of your nine lives is lost. Teleporters exchange the position of you and the ball, wall pieces can be pushed around or destroyed by your unit, floor tiles will grow into walls when you pass over them too often. The high game speed can be slowed down by holding the space key – a very useful option in tricky situations.<br><br>Titan mixes an arcade game foundation (requiring quick reflexes and good nerves) with puzzle game elements (requiring logical thinking to beat the complex levels). The challenge is to control the sphere accurately, yet indirectly.

As a demonstration of its powers, Arthur transforms the Isle of White into a giant custard slice, New York into a bath sponge and the Eiffel Tower into a toast rack. The ghost Blinky, secret agent for S.P.E.C.T.R.E. (Society for the Prevention of Ectoplasmic Crime, Telekinetic misuse and Reality Endangerment), infiltrates the madman's sea ship (the newly raised SS Titanic) armed with an ectoplasmic gun and a case full of disguises.<br><br>Titanic Blinky is a platform adventure and a clone of Dizzy, replacing the egg protagonist with a slightly effeminate ghost. As in that game, the aim is to collect objects (by pulling down on the movement controls) to solve puzzles. One main difference from Dizzy is the fact that Blinky carries a gun with infinite ammunition. There's an energy bar at the bottom of the screen that gets depleted every time Blinky touches an enemy. When it's empty, Blinky literally flips over and the player loses one life. The game starts with three lives, and there's no form of saving progress.

The crew has spent several months making repairs to their ship, but before they are able to leave the Sheriff of Lamini pleads for help. It seems that one of the island's highest ranking council members, the wizard Lord Daggan, has completely lost his senses. All sorts of strange and unusual things have been happening. He has been ranting and raving, blowing things up, and digging up the corpses of dead mystics. Daggan has remained locked up inside his castle and no one sent to confront him has been heard from since. So naturally you accept the quest.<br><br>Begin by selecting a character from the four available: Merton, the wizard; Tasler, the boy; Andros, the circus performer; or Gerand, the fighter. Then roll until you get the statistics you like for Strength, Intelligence, Wisdom, Dexterity and Constitution. Each of the characters has his own specialty.<br><br>The entire game takes place within Daggan's tower. There are 11 floors, which you can move between freely via stairs, teleporters, and the occasional levitation through a hole in the floor. There are no shops for buying and selling, so you must use what you find in the castle. As you progress through the levels, various mini-quests present themselves (charging an artifact, forging a sword, for instance). Most puzzles have been designed so they can be solved two different ways. Music plays throughout the game and the sounds of doors opening and closing, your footsteps, monster footsteps, etc. can be heard.

Description=Jim Hawkins is a young boy working on "Admiral Benbow", his parent's inn. One day a sea captain named Billy Bones takes a room at the inn and stays for several months. A blind man called Pew arrives and shows something to Billy that gives him a heart attack. Jim witness everything and runs to aid the captain, who tells him about his sea chest and his relationship with Captain Flint, a famous pirate. After her dies Jim grabs the key dangling from the corpse and opens the dead captain's chest to collect the last payment. He finds a packet inside, and decides to take it to two aristocratic acquaintances of his, Dr. Livesey and Squire John Trelawney. They discover a diary and a treasure map, and decide to travel to the island in search of the booty.<br><br>Treasure Island is a text adventure, an adaptation of the homonymous classic 1883 Scottish novel. Unlike the book, the game is written in second person. Otherwise, it follows the original plot closely: the player assumes the role of Jim Hawkins, and has to perform the same actions as the character in the novel. This leads to a more claustrophobic design, as players without knowledge of the book have to guess what to do next. To help alleviate that problem, other characters act as some sort of on-line hint system. The player can ASK them ABOUT anything and they will provide clues when these are available. The parser accepts most of the Infocom's standard features like pronouns and chain commands.

The player guides the diver in a series of rooms (100 total) where the main goal is to collect gold. The main hazard encountered is the sea life that occupied the vacant ship. The character has no weapons, but carries a limited amount of "smart fishes", trained piranhas that attack and destroy all the enemies in the room. Since the player starts with 2 fishes and only receives a new one at each 80 gold bars collected, most of the time the enemies have to be avoided by staying away or jumping over them. Stacking boxes and other objects stops the fauna from getting to the character (and also allows access to high places). There's an air gauge that is constantly depleting at the bottom-right of the screen. It can be filled with the compressed air tanks scattered in some rooms. Some doors require geometric-shaped keys. These can be collected and stored in three slots at the bottom-left of the screen. The game allows saving at each 50 gold collected.

Description=This is the earliest home computer incarnation of Horn Abbot International Ltd's classic board game, Trivial Pursuit. The game involves answering questions on one of six subject categories to gain moves, and answering questions on special squares to gain one of the six 'Wedges' you need to gain the right to take on the final winning question. Questions are aimed at British players - many entertainment questions are based on British TV, and sport questions relate to popular British sports.<br><br>Two game modes are available:- single player (which involves answering questions against the clock) and multiplayer (where you can take on up to five human-controlled players). The computer reveals the answer, and you select 'yes' or 'no' to tell it whether you got it right.<br><br>The question categories are exactly the same as the board game, however two different question styles are added to take advantage of computer technology - some questions relate to a picture or diagram and some relate to a piece of music. <br><br>One additional feature not available in the board game is a statistical analysis of the number and type of questions answered correctly. This can be split into the performances of all the players, or the performance of an individual player within the six categories. It is especially useful at the end of the game, when choosing which category a player must answer to win the game.

Description=Typhoon Thompson was an unusual game where you had to fly round an ocean and shoot at various unusual beasts.<br><br>The plot was that the "Sea Child" was stolen and Typhoon Thompson sent in to rescue it, with the guidance of a few strange, cowled ghost-types (who would occasionally be nasty to poor old TT).<br><br>The game never played like a "shoot-'em-up" - too much persistant firing was never much use - and required more tactics.

Description=The sequel to Ultima featured several improvements over the original, such as separate town and world maps, and the concept of traveling through time gates into different eras on Earth. Other than that the gameplay is pretty much the same as in Ultima I, with your single character roaming the land fighting monsters and looking for key items.<br><br>In the original Ultima a hero from a certain third rate blue planet orbiting an insignificant yellow sun came to the world of Sosaria and slew the evil wizard Mondain before he could fulfill his dreams of universal domination. Thus peace was brought to Sosaria, and the hero hailed as a champion of the people of all time. <br><br>Unfortunately, Mondain happened to have a young apprentice/lover named Minax who is understandably upset over his death. Using her considerable powers, Minax travels through time and space to the hero's homeworld of Earth and instigates a nuclear war, thus serving the dual purpose of working out her frustration as well as erasing the hero from history. Of course, as the hero, this works out rather badly for you, and so with the help of Lord British you must travel through time and somehow find Minax and prevent the events which culminate in the destruction of Earth.

Description=The fourth game in the now well-established Ultima series featured an improved game engine, with color graphics and better character interaction (you could now have actual conversations with NPCs). But what really makes Ultima IV shine is its radical departure from any other RPG made before or since in terms of the story and goal. <br><br>Instead of building up your character by any means possible in order to face the Ultimate Evil in a big bang up showdown, in Ultima IV you were trying to become the Avatar, a role model of sorts for the people of the land. This meant upholding the "eight virtues" and basically trying to become a better person. In most RPGs you chose to be a just/nice hero because the people you'd help would usually provide you with some nice equipment for your services, but in Ultima IV you helped people not for a reward or to advance the plot but simply because it was the "right thing to do". The game actually frowns on behavior that was typical of most other RPGs, such as backstabbing fleeing monsters or picking up everything that wasn't nailed down even if it didn't belong to you. The game keeps track of all your actions, so if you went about killing and looting like in most RPGs, you'd never finish the game.<br><br>This VERY different approach to the game's ultimate goal is what makes Ultima IV famous so many years later, and became the sort of design philosophy that made all the following Ultimas so unique in their genre. <br><br>Of course, the game still has plenty of traditional RPG elements such as dungeons to explore and hostile monsters to kill, as well as a typical final "Holy Grail" type quest where you had to find the Codex of Ultimate Wisdom to complete your transformation into Avatarhood.

Description=The story of the game is inspired by popular games of the same time, such as Speedball and Smash T.V.: In the not-too-distant future, the most popular television show lets contestants battle it out in an all-out fighting match called the Ultimate Arena.<br><br>What this turns out to be is a man-versus-man fighting game with digitised graphics, which was à la mode in American coin-ops at the time, such as Pit-Fighter and Mortal Kombat, complete with sprays of blood for every hit. On the Atari, the sprites aren't quite as large as in arcade games, though.<br><br>At the start of a one-player game, two characters are available to play with: Terry from France and Sandy from London. All seven characters are available to choose from in two-player mode.<br><br>Each player has the usual assortment of 18 jumps, kicks and punches, most of which are easily executed with a normal Atari joystick, as well as a few special moves. Some carry weapons, while some can fire energy bolts. Instead of the common best-out-of-three system, sudden death is enforced, so a opponent must be beaten on the first attempt. If you do so, another stands in line. Being pushed into a corner is also more dangerous than other similar games, since the ringside is electrified. Stay close to the centre of the arena, or you will be burnt to a crisp.<br><br>Released at the far end of the Atari's commercial life, Ultimate Arena is notable for being one of few STE-only games, which makes the digitised sounds and graphics more natural than had it been a normal ST game.

There is also a Bullseye right in the middle for 50 points, and an Outer Bull around it, worth 25 points. <br><br>Players always take three shots at a time. In the 501 game the aim is to reduce your score from 501 to 0, finishing with a double or the bull. If your score reaches 1 or a negative number, any shots in that set of 3 are cancelled out. In Round The Board you must hit each target in turn starting with 20, but moving back 2 or 3 for a double or treble, eventually finishing with Double Top.<br><br>Both of these games are recreated in this simulation.

At the end of each location, there is usually a boss that Tom-Tom must defeat in order to obtain a gold key that will unlock the exit gate, as well as plenty of gold coins or bags of cash. If he touches any enemies, or is shot at, he will lose health. During his travels, Tom-Tom must take note of the hourglass; if the hourglass display sands at the bottom, he must get another one that appears out of nowhere, or he'll also lose health. There are two ways in which he can restore it. He can either go into bars to have a drink that will restore it and get a hint about what lies ahead as well, or go into hospitals and heal himself to restore the lost health.

Description=Formula 1 Grand Prix is the first instalment of what would quickly become the Formula 1 simulation series for the PC in the 1990's. Designed and programmed by racing game specialist Geoff Crammond (REVS, Stunt Track Racer), Grand Prix 1 did not only introduce a multitude of features previously unknown to computer racing simulations, but also sported a physics engine that was, at its time, unmatched in its complexity and realism. Grand Prix 1 features:<br><br>1. 3D graphics out of filled, unshaded polygons on PC and Amiga - the PC version has pavement and lawn textures. The sheer number of track-side details (down to billboards and camera cranes) forced any computer below a decent 386 DX to its knees.<br><br>2. Working rear mirrors. Though they show only cars and no scenery, they are invaluable for blocking overtakers.<br><br>3. Collisions with flying debris and actual crude damage models: wings are visibly bent after crashes.<br><br>4. Wet weather that influences traction. No rain graphics, but a fog effect obscures your vision when you drive in another car's splash water.<br><br>5. An extensive tuning part that greatly influences the performance of your car. In-race setup allows you to adjust gear ratios, brake balance, wing downforce and tires during each visit to the box.<br><br>6. Six optional driving aids that help F1 rookies finish their race: toggle best line and suggested gear displays to learn track tactics, or have auto brakes, auto gears, self-righting spins and indestructability improve your driving.<br><br>7. A replay system that lets you watch race scenes from three different views, including track-side cameras.<br><br>Formula 1 Grand Prix includes all 16 international GP circuits of 1991. You may drive them in quick race mode, single race or a full championship. The 18 teams and 35 drivers and their performance are based on the 1991 season, but the game doesn't include real names. You can edit and save team and driver names by hand.<br><br>While the Amiga version allows multiplayer races in hotseat mode, the PC version originally had solo races only. In 1993, the v1.05 update added modem support (and a couple of other improvements). Find it in the related links section.

Three human officers sleep in cryogenic tanks, awakened only for routine system checks – or in case of an emergency. With a hum, the cryogenic control springs on-line as Beacon’s long-range sensors detect incoming lifeforms.<br><br>Controlling one of the on-board officers, you have to defend the station against swarms of plasmodian spores (the “Wreckers”) showering down on Beacon and seeping into its four sections. While the spores approach, you can suck them out of space with a gigantic hoover-like space hose. Once they settle onto the stations hull, jump into the space suit and spray infected areas with a cleansing agent. Undetected spores will seep into the station’s corridors, where you must hunt them down with a plasma shots and avoid being shot in return.<br><br>In addition, up to ten droids are under your (indirect) control. Ranging from cleaners to fighters to engineers, these automatons will act independently, but can be sent to key locations within the station -- i.e. infected areas. As your officer gains experience through battles, he will be promoted to higher ranks, enabling him to construct more efficient fighter robots in the station’s droid factory.<br><br>Since plasmodians running rampant in the station will cause system malfunctions, your main goal is to clear infections quickly and make sure that Beacon continues to function properly. To make things worse, an self-destruct mechanism will explode the station in 60 minutes unless all signs of spore activity cease. <br><br>Effective droid construction and assignment, quick reactions to approaching swarms and good reflexes thus combine into a challenging race against time that makes Wreckers stand out as a clever twist of the “alien invasion” action archetype.

The plot overlaps however, with the Xenites making their first attempt to control the galaxy.<br><br>Xenon is essentially an overhead shooter, where the player controls the ship and moves around the screen. However, the difference between Xenon and its sequel is that here the player actually controls the movement of the playfield (up or down) by simply moving the ship in the direction of choice. To do this in the sequel, players need to slam your ship against the bottom of the screen and pull back on the stick in order to reverse-scroll the playfield.<br><br>It also features a 3D playfield (some enemies, for example, will be mounted on hills of sort, where players can't shoot them). To combat these the player can transform its tank into a plane. The game then switches to the more familiar gameplay style as seen in other vertically scrolling shooters. The plane has to transform back into a tank again to combat most ground units.<br><br>In Xenon, upgrades are taken from destroyed enemies.

Description=Zak McKracken is a tabloid reporter (and not a very good one at that).  Based upon a psychadelic dream, Zak one day realizes that something is wrong -- Space Aliens are dumbifying the general public through the telephone system.  Zak must stop this, but he can't do it alone.  After finding a magic crystal (or some sort of crystal), Zak manages to get the help of Anthropologist, Annie, and her friends, Melissa and Leslie.  Between the four characters (all of which you control), you can destroy the dumbifying devices and save the earth.  Not too bad for a tabloid reporter.

Description=At its most basic level, Zero Gravity can be thought of as a Pong game, as the player controls a bat which must be used to hit a ball as it comes towards you. The main twist is that the gameplay is completely 3-dimensional, with control over the horizontal and vertical positions of the bat. The game uses a split-screen view, with the top half from player 1's perspective, and the bottom from player's 2, even when only one player is human.<br><br>Each time you get the ball past your opponent's bat, a score is added to a tally, and a number of points are awarded. Along the side-wall of the playing arena there are 8 tokens to be hit, awarding extra points, speeding the game up, deducting points from your opponent, and so on.

Instead, it communicates with the player via text, and the player interacts with the game by typing commands, such as "examine mailbox" or "take torch".

It is one of the first "text adventures" and is widely considered to be one of the great classics of the genre which reached the peak of its popularity in the '80s.

Races are also longer in this mode, and pit-stops are activated, required if the player knocks on too many objects or other cars frequently. <br><br>3. Free Practice: This allows the player to drive on any race without caring for championship positions. There are two options in Free Practice: Free Run is just the player against the clock and Image Training is a race, but instead of having to quality and then run the three laps, the player can set the number of laps (between one and six), starting position and the condition of the track (dry or wet, only on some circuits).<br><br>While each mode presents it's own variations, the core of each race is the same: Along controller setup options, the player can choose between an Automatic or Manual with 4 or 7 speeds gearbox, and races against 16 drivers.

Description=Sega's 8-bit systems received their own version of the Genesis' popular Disney platformer. Story and themes remain the same, but the game has unique levels and slightly different gameplay mechanics.<br><br>To save his girlfriend Minnie from the evil witch Mizrabel, Mickey Mouse must venture into the Castle of Illusion. Crossing six levels (including a magical forest, a toy land and a candy world), he must collect the gems of the rainbow in order to confront and defeat the witch.<br><br>Each level features unique obstacles, enemies and a final boss. The enemies can be defeated by jumping on top of them. An alternative way is to pick up objects lying around (like rocks in the forest or blue balls in the toy level) and throwing them at the enemies. Mickey's ability to pick up things and carry them around also leads to puzzle-oriented gameplay. By placing objects in the right spot and jumping off of them, he can get to areas otherwise out of reach. In some levels, he also has to collect keys to open doors. A unique type of object is the treasure chest - by jumping on top of one or throwing it, Mickey gets access to its contents, which might include extra lives, a health power-up or coins to collect for points.

However, in columns they are groups of 3 same-size but varying color blocks, which must be arranged into sequences of 3 or more, either horizontally, vertically or diagonally. Sequences of 4 or 5 count for double or triple points, and diagonal sequences score the most. The real trick is to set up 'combos' - where one line causes other blocks to drop so as to create other lines.<br><br>As well as the normal game mode, there is also a 'flash' mode, in which the aim is simply to remove a particular block from the base of the pre-formed pile of bricks.

Description=The Game Gear version of the grand old lady of war simulations, Daisenryaku, arranges a war between the fictive Red and Blue countries. On one of thirty different maps, units are produced and moved out into combat, and the war is only over when the enemy capital has been conquered.<br><br>Three basic phases make up each turn: production, movement and combat. Each city or airbase within a distance of five hexagons from your capital may produce one unit each turn, as long as your funds allow it. Each turn yields new funds, whose amount is proportional to the number of cities and airports you have occupied.<br><br>Units are moved on the map, which is based on "fake hexagons"; the hexagons are in fact square, but offset on each row so that each square borders six other squares. Each terrain type has different movement and defence values, which makes movement and combat more complicated.<br><br>The outcome of combat is determined by the attack strength which varies between different unit types, and by their experience. Each time a unit survives combat, it gains experience points and eventually gains in experience level, which makes the chance of winning in combat higher. As each unit is in fact a squadron of ten, a typical combat will only destroy a certain number of the members of the unit.<br><br>An additional moment in the gameplay is the recharging phase. Units which have lost members can be built up to full force in a city or airbase, and those which have run out of ammunition can do the same. Ammunition can also be replenished in the battlefield using supply trucks.<br><br>A total of thirteen airbourne and land-based units are available. Some units cannot fight other units; tanks can do nothing against bombers, and mechanised infantry can't protect itself well against a howitzer two squares away.<br><br>The game can be played both against the computer or against another human player by linking two Game Gears together.

Other levels are platforming affairs: Aladdin must run, jump and climb, find keys or switches to open doors while searching for the exit. Rocks can be collected and be thrown to dispatch enemies or hit buttons otherwise out of reach. Finally, there are also several magic carpet rides in the game, in which the level scrolls automatically and the player must make sure to avoid any obstacles in the way.

Description=Dragon Crystal is a dungeon crawler with RPG elements, along the lines of classics such as Rogue or Nethack. Without relying on a story, the game throws you into a randomly generated world which you should explore carefully - and most importantly, where you must survive! The complex, maze-like levels reveal their structure only after you cover the corresponding map areas. Your goal in each level is to reach a teleporter which will take you to the next one. There are also a lot of random items scattered around - weapons, armor, money, and food. Money allows you to continue the game if you die, food prevents you from starving. The enemies are visible on screen, and you fight them in a fast-paced turn-based combat, moving around and pressing direction arrows to strike with the equipped weapon. You are always accompanied by an egg which will eventually grow up to be a dragon if you have leveled up enough.

Differently from its Genesis counterpart, the game is played from a first or third person point of view, with the fighters facing each other directly. The player can choose to see the fight from his or from the opponent's point of view ("through his eyes").<br><br>Players can either play a quick exhibition match or fight their way through the Career mode, using a created boxer to work their way up the 15-boxer ranking list until they fight Holyfield himself. During character creation, players can choose the fighter's head, color of skin, trunks and hair, physical and mental attributes. The physical attributes are dominant hand, power, speed, recovery and stamina. The mental attributes are style (brawler, dancer, boxer and dodger), killer instinct (low, medium or high) and favorite punches (jabs, straights or hooks aimed at head or torso, one for each hand). Between matches, career mode offers various exercises to assign the boxer to improve his stats.<br><br>The players can choose the view mode (normal or reverse), three kinds of control schemes, round length (up to four minutes) and fight length (up to 12 rounds).

Rounds one and three are played in Switch Mode: step on different switches to rotate associated sections of the conveyor belt. If you get off the switch, the section rotates back to its initial position. One switch may affect more than one section. Since you can only step on one switch at a time, you have to bustle quite a bit in later stages. Rounds two and four are played in Bridge Mode: remove and install small bridges between the belts to control the flow of products.<br><br>If a person gets an unwanted product, the time remaining on the timer will decrease.

The options available follow the standard set: fouls and offsides can be toggled on and off, the match length can be set, and if the timer operates  continuously, or only while the ball is in play. Gameplay privileges quick runs, short passes and blistering shots outside the penalty box, and set pieces are controlled by moving a box into the target area for the ball, and then passed, lobbed or kicked directly. On the tactical side, formations can be selected, with 5 different strategies also available (although not all of these combinations make sense) as can the team Coverage - the areas which defenders, midfielders and strikers cover.

Description=Galaga '90 is a port of the arcade game Galaga '88.<br><br>Galaga '90 takes the basic gameplay of Galaga and adds nicer graphics, triple ship abilities, parsec progression, power-ups, asteroids, bosses and other enhancements.<br><br>Periodically the player encounters Challenging Stages, which are set to music and feature "dancing" enemies.  The objective is to shoot all 40 enemies before they disappear, for a bonus of at least 10,000 points.<br><br>There are a total of 29 stages.  You can begin with 1 ship with 2 in reserve or start right out with a dual ship (but only one in reserve).  <br><br>Some enemies now have the ability to combine into a much larger single enemy that takes multiple shots to destroy. <br>Some enemies explode in a brilliant shower of fireworks when destroyed, and occasionally these enemies drop a small formation of much smaller enemies that "wiggle" their way down the screen.  Some enemies arrive in spherical "eggs" and emit a loud, high-pitched noise when hit. These creatures take multiple hits to destroy in flight (just one hit in formation), and their main attack pattern is to move about halfway down the screen, stop, fire multiple shots at once, and then fly straight down off the bottom of the screen.  Another type of enemy takes at least five hits to destroy, and it grows larger with each consecutive hit, making it both a larger target and allowing it to act as a shield to other enemies. <br><br>Later in the game some enemies are equipped with armor that renders them invincible while in formation. When one of these enemies starts its dive, it will flip over and expose its vulnerable side, then flip over again and become invincible while it moves back up the screen, then flip one more time and finish its dive. While vulnerable, this enemy can be destroyed in one hit, scoring bonus points. <br><br>In addition, many different kinds of obstacles appear throughout the game, including blue crystals, boulders and green blobs.

Compared to the other titles, these versions have new opponents and show the boxers from the side. Players can move left or right in the ring to avoid punches. Other moves including blocking, and left and right punches that can be varied into jabs and crosses. Matches can last up to ten rounds and when no regular or technical knock-out occurs, the winner is based on the jury's points, provided between the rounds. During knock-out phases, no buttons need to be pressed to get the boxer back to his feet. At the start of the game, a slow or fast speed for the gameplay can be selected.<br><br>Each match the player's boxer can use three super punches. These need to be charged and then unleashed when near an opponent. It sends them straight to the back of the ring, a dangerous area as it is easy to keep punching them into the ropes. Health is slightly restored during the intermission and after each won match the player is awarded skill points to be distributed over three characteristics. Matches for two players are supported.

The usual Aleste powerup systems remains fairly intact. You still have powerup pods which release P capsules for upgrading your main weapon. On the other hand, secondary weapon upgrades are no longer released from ground bases, but from another type of flying pods. When you start out, your secondary weapon is a laser, which can later be replaced with powerups ranging from split fire to napalm rockets and target seeking power balls. Both primary and secondary weapons are in constant use, since only button 2 is used for firing both weapons at once. Due to the smaller screen estate of the Game Gear, the sprites are larger and the playfield more constrained, for which the game compensates somewhat by introducing multidirectionally scrolling sections.

Description=Head Buster is a so-called future sports game about robots. On a top-down, horizontally scrolling playfield, armed robots are moved around in a manner similar to Super Robot Taisen strategy games, albeit without many of the refinements of that series.<br><br>Each game starts at the shop, where robots on your team are bought and equipped according to your tastes and finances. After that, the game begins in the robot arena, blue team against red team in one corner each. The goal is not explicitly to destroy the robots of the opposing team, but to destroy their base. In order to reach their base, and to prevent them from reaching yours, a certain amount of fighting is required. Each turn is split into a movement phase and a combat phase, and since actions of both sides are only executed when a phase is over, you cannot know when moving how close you will get to your opponents.<br><br>Robots are available in three basic classes, from light to heavy, but can be modified with new movement units (different terrain squares have different movement properties), better armour and new weapons. Different weapons have both different strength and different ranges, as well as a limited supply of bullets. Reloading is done during the combat phase, but requires that your robot stays out of combat during that turn. Different sensors and command units can also be added, giving the robots better aim or particular abilities such as dodging, shielding and healing.

Description=Judge Dredd is a platform action game based on the British comic book character of the same name and the 1995 movie that tarnished that name.  The game was a multi system release so it fits the standard console jump/shoot/duck formula although it does add some unique twists such as wounding enemies so that they surrender and can be arrested.<br><br>The initial levels follow the plot of the movie with futuristic lawman Judge Dredd framed and sent to the Aspen penal colony from which he must escape and prove his innocence.  Following the fight at the top of the Statue of Liberty that ended the film, the game continues on with levels and characters inspired by the comic book culminating with a battle against the Dark Judges on Deadworld.

If the player survives long enough, a boss battle against an especially powerful dinosaur follows.<br><br>After the completion of the driving section the level continues with a platform section. The player must jump, duck and climb to survive moving lifts, floors that will crumble under his feet, environmental hazards like acid drops, steam leaks or giant boulders and more.

Navigating the often maze-like levels will lead to the dinosaur that must be captured and a corresponding boss fight.<br><br>The first four levels (featuring a Velociraptor, Pteranodon, Triceratops and Brachiosaurus) can be tackled in any order, but the final level, featuring the Tyrannosaurus Rex, is only unlocked when the others have been completed.

Description=The Game Gear version of Kinetic Connection has been rearranged a lot from the original version released 5 years earlier to cope with a smaller screen and Sega's taste in motifs.<br><br>As the original version, Kinetic Connection is a jigsaw puzzle game, where the pieces are animated. This makes putting the pieces together to form the overall picture both more interesting and more difficult, since the player can not analyse each piece at his own pace when the entire puzzle is moving about. Pieces also need to be flipped around both on the X and Y axis in order to fit together.<br><br>The game has 7 puzzles, some of which are carried over from the earlier versions but mostly new ones designed with Sega characters. Due to the small screen, the pieces are not kept in a box at the bottom of the screen as in the original Kinetic; instead they are all placed out on the grid already, in a random order. Each puzzle can be played in three different modes:<br><br>Mode 1 lets the player swap pieces around as he likes. Mode 2 lacks one piece and lets the player slide pieces around as in a sliding puzzle. Mode 3 lets the player slide entire rows and columns around in the puzzle. The two second modes call for much more thought when solving the moving puzzles.

Description="Last Bible Special" is a part of Last Bible series, which are a sub-series within the  Megaten universe. The events of "Last Bible Special" take place in an alternate Middle East in the beginning of the Christian era. You play as Materu, a young warrior who gets an assignment from the bishop of Jerusalem to travel to four dungeons. The demon king Graias is controlling other demons who found their hideout in those dungeons, and it's your task to defeat them.<br><br>Unlike the three previous Last Bible games, "Last Bible Special" features 3D first-person dungeons, like in mainstream  Shin Megami Tensei games. The game is heavier on dungeon crawling: you cannot travel on the world map, but are taken automatically to the huge dungeons which you should complete in a specific order. In the town, you can buy items, as well as recruit party members. The battles are random and turn-based. Like in all Megaten games, you can communicate with the demons you encounter and convince them to join your party.

Description=If you're bored of racing Formula 1 cars, rally cars or MotoGP bikes in their natural habitats, the Micro Machines series could be for you. It involves racing miniatures representing particular vehicle types across a particular terrain found around the house. The Sports Cars race on the desktop, 4x4s in the sandpit, Formula 1 cars on a snooker table, and so on.<br><br>These levels were packed with variation. The Snooker tables has the track painted on, although this is open to deviation (as are most levels), and had you racing through the pockets and across the rim of the table. Tanks raced as well, with the chance of shooting out your opponent if they got directly in front of you. The desktop levels include binders to jump across, pencil-sharpeners to avoid, and lots of visual jokes in the open homework.<br><br>Viewed from overhead with small graphics, the races include up to 4 cars. In one player challenge mode you race through the 21 tracks in a set order, selecting your 3 opponents as you go along (adding a fair amount of strategy - ideally you should aim to eliminate the better CPU cars early on), eliminating one after every third race (assuming that you can finish in the top 2 of a race within your 3 lives). If you win 3 races in a row without using a continue you get a time-trial race which can earn you an extra life.<br><br>The real innovation of the game was in the multiplayer modes. You started with 4 points each, and when one car gets far enough ahead to force the other car off-screen, the slider moves in their favour. Once it reached the end (which involved beating them 4 times more than they beat you) you win the level, although if 3 laps were completed, the person leading at that point is declared the winner - with a sudden death play off if scores are level. 9 of the tracks are available in this mode, although you can also play this Head to Head system as a 1-player game across all the tracks.

The fulfillment of the goals may be complicated by the fact that you are given only Puyos of a certain colour to work with.<br><br>The game has also an edit mode, where you can make your own puzzles given all the options described above.

Description=The official game of the Games of the XXV Olympiad, held in Barcelona in 1992, featuring seven different events: 100M Sprint, Hammer Throw, Archery, 110M Hurdles, Pole Vault, Springboard diving and 200M Freestyle Swimming.<br><br>Gameplay features the typical button mashing formula used by Epyx during the 80s. 100M Sprint, 110M Hurdles and 200M Freestyle Swimming feature a button mashing sequence with just some changes: in the hurdles the player must hit the action key to jump over a hurdle (the timing sets the loss of speed) and in swimming, the sequence takes over one and an half minutes and the action button touches the edge for the return swim. In these events, the player initially faces a semi-final round and only qualifies for the final if ends in the top half. It's possible to watch the other semi-final.<br>Hammer Throw combines a strong mashing sequence, along an accurate press of the action button to release the hammer, while Pole Vault combines an initial mashing sequence, a first tap on down to set the bar, then pressing up and the action button to release the pole and jump over the bar. Archery is a technical event where the player has three rounds with six arrows each, the winner being the one with the highest score on all three rounds.<br><br>The player can choose to compete for eight nations: Great Britain, France, Germany, Italy, hosts Spain, United Stats, Japan and the CIS (formerly the Soviet Union). Each nation has it's own sample of the anthem and a set of athletes to compete against the player. Each athlete is unique, and will perform differently according the the event: in some they are capable of braking World Records, in others, lucky enough to get to a final or a top-6 spot. The competition is split in two tables: sorted by medals and by total score (the gold medalist gets 24 points, the 12th only 13).

Description=Bruno is a baby Ottifant. It's an ordinary evening, and Bruno's dad is working late at office. Reason enough for Bruno's vivid imagination to run riot, thinking that his dad has been kidnapped by aliens! Jelly babies, that fell from his father's pocket on the way to work, blaze a trail to the office. Now it's up to Bruno to fight his way through hordes of terrorizing toys, Ottifant-eating plants, tear through gloomy caverns of doom and cut across a perilous jungle - workaday objects and boringly normal settings as seen through kids' eyes - and rescue his dad!<br><br>The Ottifants for the SEGA Game Gear is a 2D side-scrolling platformer where the player controls Bruno through five worlds: starting with the house and the basement, through to the building site, the office and finally the jungle, whereas each world is in turn divided into three stages. Bruno's primary weapon is his trunk, which gives him the ability to blast enemies by firing sweets at them, or suck in objects like out-of-reach platforms or boxes by holding down the Fire-button. Furthermore, yellow, green and red lollies are spread throughout the stages. Gathering three of them activate one of Bruno's special skills and can - depending on the colour combination - transform the baby Ottifant into Superfant with the ability to fly, boost his speed with Speedy Shoes, give an extra Continue and more. <br><br>Picking up jelly babies, blasting enemies and collecting papers gives points and raises Bruno's score up to a fixed value of 9,999 pts. There are several entrances to secret rooms hidden in the five worlds. But, unlike the Genesis-version, the rooms are quite small and basic and there is no 1,000 point reward by completing them. On the whole there are two different tunes backing your journey through the game: one for the stages and one for the boss enemies. The varied background music and sound effects of the Genesis-game are completely missing, as is one entire world: The Garden.

Description=Based on Namco's Japanese-only arcade puzzler Cosmo Gang the Puzzle, Pac-Attack is similar to many block-dropping puzzle games from the time, such as Puyo Puyo.<br><br>The objective of the game is to place ghosts and then, after three pieces (which can include one or two blocks as well), make Pac-Man eat as many ghosts as possible to try and clear up the game area. Pac-Man's directions are chosen at random between left or right, but as he goes moving on the game area (after you place him, of course), if he bumps against a block or a "wall" on the game area, he will change his direction. As with many block-dropping puzzlers, if a line of blocks and/or ghosts reaches the top, the game ends. However, by filling up a meter on the left of the game area, a fairy may appear that can clear approximately 6 or 7 lines with ghosts, but it only clears the ghosts, although the blocks that were on top of them will drop.<br><br>Also, like many puzzlers, it contains a versus mode against another human player. It's similar to the many versus modes of puzzle games: eat plenty of ghosts and your opponent will recieve many ghosts on his area.<br><br>The game also includes a Puzzle mode. It features 100 levels, in which you have to eat all ghosts with no more than 4 Pac-Men at least (the number reduces in certain levels), and, unlike the other modes, you can change Pac-Man's direction with the press of a button.<br><br>All of the handheld versions (including the one on Pac-Man Collection) lack the versus mode.

These are upgraded in the same vein as in GG Aleste until you reach a frightening potential, covering the screen in bullets and napalm explosions. As a last resort, you're also given the ultimate weapon; a smart bomb destroying all enemies on-screen. Unfortunately, you're only given one bomb per life. As far as the weapons arsenal goes, this is the pinnacle in 8-bit Aleste versions. The graphics have been revised with a clearer look which turns out better on the Game Gear's fuzzy screen.<br>Perhaps taking a cue from the Sonic games of the time, the bonus levels are in 3-D, giving you the chance to earn bonus points and extra lives by shooting down as many baddies as possible in Galaxy Force style.

Description=Bart vs. The Space Mutants is a platform game where the player goes into the role of Bart Simpson (from the TV show The Simpsons) and must stop the Space Mutants from invading Springfield.<br><br>On each of the five levels, Bart must collect (or get rid of) the ingredients that the Space Mutants are planning to use to build their machine, such as purple objects or balloons. He also has to collect enough "proof" of the aliens existence (brown coins left behind when they are jumped on), so his family members will help him when he meets a boss (characters such as Nelson and Sideshow Bob). This won't be easy since the Space Mutants are "using" human bodies as disguise. In order to discover who are the real Space Mutants, Bart must use his X-ray Specs.<br><br>The ways Bart can get rid of those objects sought by the Space Mutants are numerous. For instance, in the first stage, Bart must get rid of purple objects. He can dye them red, cover them, wash them, etc. Some even involve a little puzzle solving, like playing a trick on Moe to make him get out of the bar.<br><br>Bart also has some coins that can be used in many ways throughout the game, like buying things, getting devices operating, etc. Those coins are essential to solve some puzzles in the game.

You set off in your little submarine and board the ship where a horde of passengers desperately need your keen oversight and "shipsmarts".<br><br>In 60 levels you have to rescue as many passengers (dubbed the Dim Passengers) as possible. At the beginning the passengers fall through a tube in the level. Similar to Lemmings you have to find a way for the passengers to the exit of the level. In order to do so, you must blast hindrances such cargo boxes and bulkheads with bombs or, when no bombs are left, reposition the boxes with a crane. There are also conveyor belts in the levels. If the belt moves in the wrong way, the passengers either can't use it or may even be transported to their dooms, being dropped off into water, fire or steam jets. You can usually choose the direction of the belts by pulling a lever.<br><br>There are several types of scenarios that Kevin Codner (you) are faced with throughout the game. Of course the puzzles get progressively more difficult, involving things like patching up cracked pipes to stop a lethal jet of steam from cooking the distressed passengers. You can blast away obstacles and stack crates in creative manners. For instance, you can have them fall onto each other to form a bridge across a gap or to provide shielding from fire. This is usually done by hoisting them onto conveyor belts using a crane.<br><br>Each level has a certain "save limit", meaning you have to save at least a certain amount of passengers. This again is akin a bit towards Lemmings, and lots of levels have a built-in time limit, represented be water pouring into the compartment, rising ominously. When the water rises high enough, the passengers will get carried along with it, and they can only swim for a short period of time before getting exhausted and drowning, so you'd better be on time with some assistance.<br><br>At the end of each level you receive a password (again, Lemmings-style) so that you may pick up your game from the current level without having to progress through them all from the get-go.

Sonic can pick up golden rings for protection (when hit, he simply loses all of his rings instead of a life) and bonuses: 100 rings gain Sonic an extra life, and 50 remaining rings at the end of a level allow access to pinball-themed special stages full of bumpers and springs. The final level of a zone is always a boss fight against Robotnik.<br><br>Sonic should also collect the six Chaos Emeralds to keep them from falling into Robotnik's hands.

Description=The handheld version of Stargate is a matching puzzle game, similar to a 3-D  Tetris. Players drop tiles into a Stargate, and try to stack three identical symbols. Doing so clears those tiles. Mismatched tiles simply build stacks higher and higher, and the player loses if the tiles reach the top of the gate. The player is also given a seven-symbol Stargate "address" along the top of the screen. Stacking three copies of a symbol listed in the address will clear the stack and counts toward completing the address.<br><br>There are two game modes building on this basic concept:<br><br>1. Skill Mode is a single-player challenge where the player tries to complete as many addresses as they can before being overwhelmed. Speed increases with completed addresses.<br><br>Battle Mode can be played against the computer, or against a second player connected with a link cable. In Battle Mode, any stacks you clear are sent through the Stargate and appear on your opponent's side. A height level meter is added on the sides to show how close you and your opponent are to overflowing their gates. You can win by outlasting your opponent (while sending complete stacks through to make things more difficult for them) or by being the first to complete the address.

Description=Beyond the Nexus is based on the seventh Star Trek movie and its story: Captains Kirk and Picard must team up to stop a mad scientist from destroying an inhabited planet so that he might reenter the mysterious Nexus energy ribbon.<br><br>The game has several different playing modes. The first is starship combat: seen from the main screen of the Enterprise (both the -B or the -D version) you navigate the ship through space, firing phasers or photon torpedoes at enemies like Tholians, Klingons and Romulans. Another mode has you navigating the ship to its destination by flying through rectangles in space.<br><br>On away missions, the view switches to a top-down perspective where you control a single character and can fire your phaser at enemies.<br><br>Finally, the game has two puzzle modes. In the first one, frequencies must be decoded: this is done by putting symbols into the right order. One can only guess the order at first, but after an attempt the game reveals how many of the selected symbols are part of the combination and how many are in the right place. Using logic, the right order can be determined, but there are only a limited number of tries.<br><br>The second puzzle mode is used to reroute power from one system to another. To do so, a path must be built on a grid for the energy to flow through. The path must be built out of randomly assigned pieces that don't always fit together, similar to the concept of Pipe Mania.

Description=Streets of Rage, Sega's answer to Final Fight, follows the story of three young police officers (Adam Hunter, Axel Stone and Blaze Fielding) in a city controlled by a criminal syndicate led by a "Mr. X" where crime is rampant, which leads the three heroes to make a pact to leave the force and topple the syndicate by themselves.<br><br>Gameplay is straightforward and simple. Three buttons are used, one to jump, other to attack and another to perform a range attack from a support police car. Each character has a limited set of moves that include punching and kicking or performing a back attack (if in the open), two grapple moves (depending if holding the opponent in front or by the back), a flying attack, and if playing with another player two additional tag attacks, and different abilities: Adam is slow, but a good jumper and a hard hitter, Axel fast and also a hard hitter, but a lousy jumper and Blaze fast and a good jumper, but weak hitter.<br>Levels are in typical arcade side-scroller fashion: move from left to right (with two exceptions), clearing screens from enemies one after another as fast as possible while avoid taking damage with a boss in the end. Some levels feature "death drops" where the player must avoid falling, while throwing enemies there at the same time, including a typical elevator level.  Several items are scattered on the ground, from melee weapons and bonus points (and lives or additional police cars) to apples and turkeys (to restore health).

Tails gears up and heads for his quest to find the machine parts to build his weapon to defeat the evil Battle Kukku. There are however major plot differences between the Japanese and the western release.

While resting there, a large explosion occurs and a Flicky tells him birds are invading the island.<br><br>Unlike the other games in the series, this spin-off is less of a traditional platformer, but has a much slower pace with rpg elements and a focus on puzzle-solving. Tails can walk, jump, fly (momentarily), hang on ledges and throw bombs.

Per level however, he is only allowed to bring along four and this adds a tactical dimension. One of the most vital tools is the Remote Robot that can squeeze through small areas that Tails cannot reach. Underwater he changes into the small submarine Sea Fox.

Description=Tempo Jr. is platforming game and sequel to Tempo on the Sega 32X. The player again takes control of the cute grasshopper Tempo and guides him through various stages. The goal in each level is just to find the exit. Each level consists of two stages and a boss fight. After finishing a level, Tempo can take part in a mini game if he found coins in the completed level and win additional points or lives. Tempo can shoot notes from his hands to stun enemies, which will then automatically be kicked away on contact. He can also use his wings to move faster, float in the air or fall more slowly and more controlled.

Description=Tesserae is a 2-d combination of Rubic's Cube and the more advanced levels of Q-Bert. Simple yet colorful symbol graphics make for endless hours of gameplay... akin to how one can play MineSweeper or Tetris on end, this game got into your head. Gameplay consisted of "flipping" tesserae, or tiles, from squares over adjacent squares. The result would either create a complex tile, or cancel out, resulting in the deletion of a tile. The goal was to clear the board entirely. Higher levels were designated by added tile complexity, and larger board grid sizes.

Description=Ultimate Soccer is a football (European) game composed by 64 (unlicensed) international teams, each with it's own values for running, ball control and strength. There are five game modes (friendly, penalty shootout, tournament, playoff and league), but the lack of password or built-in battery means each one of them must be completed in one sitting.<br><br>The gameplay can be tweaked for the players' preference by changing several key aspects of the physics engine, such as wind strength and direction, ball weight (lighter balls travel higher, faster  and farther but are more prone to be deflected by winds than heavy balls, who barely lift of the ground and are slowed down by wet grass), tightness of ball control and players speed and momentum. A five-a-side mode, where the ball is never out of play is also included. Thanks to the many options regarding the physics, the game allows a lot of flexibility in playmaking, from building up the play with small passes from the midfield to belting the ball upwards in hope of a goalmouth deflection.<br><br>Graphically, the game is similar to EA's Madden NFL series, with pseudo-3D effects allowing the view to be tilted up to show more detail up front or tilted down to show more of the field. <br><br>The series later continued with Striker on the same console and Striker' 96 on PC, Saturn and PlayStation.

Sega's answer was called Woody Pop.<br><br>With a wooden paddle, which in fact is Woody the tree spirit, you bounce your ball against bricks laid out in a big house filled with toys. The toys will come out to disturb you. When you hit "mystery bricks", wind-up toy soldiers or robots come out, obstructing your ball. On some levels, a toy train will cross your path as well. Speaking of wells, the bottom of the screen is not a big black hole as in most other games of this kind  instead the whole covers only a part of the wall, so that even if you miss the ball, it might bounce back in the corners.<br><br>Once a room is cleared, you can choose freely between up to three adjacent rooms to progress to, making this game less linear than usual.<br><br>Like any post-Arkanoid game, there is a range of powerups released from special blocks. Most are known from other games such as the double-ball, the growing bat or the "diamond ball", which destroys all blocks in its path without ricocheting. Some invented by Sega are the fire ball, which sets blocks on fire, allowing them to destroy even neighbouring blocks, and the big ball, which hits bricks with more power, thereby destroying brick with one hit that would otherwise have required several.

To make matters worse, Gamesmaster has promised the X-Men's arch-rivals that if they can stop the X-Men from completing their tasks that they can have the antidote and destroy the only hope for mankind.<br><br>The gameplay is a 2D side-scrolling beat-em-up with eight stages total that range from the Arctic to Egypt and the Moon with the ability for the player to choose the location they wish to explore first at the beginning of the game.

Description=Yu Yu Hakusho: Horobishi Mono no Gyakushu is based on the the manga / anime series Yu Yu Hakusho, which is about the teenage delinquent Yusuke Urameshi, who is appointed as an "Underworld Detective" after being killed in a car accident  while trying to save a child's life. His task is to investigate various cases involving ghosts and demons in the human world.<br><br>The game is a classic side-scrolling beat'em up and offers several characters from the manga to play. Apart from, as expected, Yusuke the player can choose between Hiei, Kuwabara and Kurama. All characters have different values in five attributes like jumping or speed. The game offers some variations from the standard beta'em up formula: There are four different levels accessible from the beginning and can be played through in any order. However, after completing level, the player has to choose a new character he hasn't used yet for the next stage. If a character looses all his health, he has to fill it up with the health of the other characters and thus weakening them for the later levels. The game also switches to different mode for the boss fights. By turns, the player has to dodge an attack from the boss and then do a attack on his own by pressing Punch at the time when a moving cross-hair is over the boss.

Description=007: The World is Not Enough is a James Bond game based on the 1999 movie of the same name.  Both game and film follow Bond's investigation of attacks on a British oil tycoon's new pipeline, while the game introduces new areas and backstory not seen in the film. James Bond is a MI5 agent that employs gadgets and gunplay. With each mission requiring the player to complete specific objectives outlined in a pre-mission briefing.<br><br>In contrast to the PlayStation title of the same name, this version is structured more like a successor to Rare's GoldenEye 007. There are 14 missions with three difficulty settings (Agent, Special Agent, 00 Agent), and higher difficulty settings add increasingly complicated objectives to each mission. An "Awards" system encourages replay by granting new multiplayer skins, maps, and modes for beating target times for single-player levels.<br><br>The game includes a local, split-screen multiplayer mode for up to four players, or a combination of computer-controlled bots. Some levels are taken from single-player mode, while others are exclusive to multiplayer. New game modes include King of the Hill, Capture The Briefcase, and Last Agent Standing. The notorious Golden Gun also returns from GoldenEye 007, and retains its one-shot-kill power. Weapon groups and victory conditions can be tweaked at the start of a multiplayer match.

Description=Animal Crossing, dubbed a "communication game" by Nintendo, is an updated version of Animal Forest + on the Nintendo 64.<br><br>In Animal Crossing, you arrive at a new town (named by you).  You play as one character (who you also name) throughout the game.  For an example, I named my character James, after me, and the town Toronto, after the city I grew up in.<br><br>Animal Crossing has no set goal; instead, it's more of a Sims type game, in which you can do what you want, when you want, without rules, goals or time limit.<br><br>When you first arrive, you will be given a house to live in.  Unfortunately, you have no money, so the owner decides to make you work at his store.  You can perform various tasks, such as planting flowers and trees around the store, in which you get paid in "bells", the game's form of currency.  There are also other ways to make money; you can perform various tasks for the other citizens of the town, you can fish and then sell your caught fish, you can collect items and sell them, or you can just "find" money.<br><br>The most unique feature of Animal Crossing is it's use of the GameCube's internal clock.  The game will run according to what your clock is set at.  If your GameCube clock says it's 2:45 in the afternoon on October 1st, the game will take place at that time.  If you don't play the game until October 5th, the game will pick up on October 5th.  The game also uses the clock to serve a night/day cycle, a seasons cycle, and a festivities cycle.  When your clock reads December 15th, the game will show snow on the ground and snow falling.  When the clock reads December 25th, you will see various Christmas activities, such as Santa suits.  The same applies to Halloween, Valentine's Day, etc.  The game also has a night/day cycle, meaning if you play the game at 4:00pm, it'll be bright, and if you play at 11:00pm, it'll be dark.<br><br>Another unique feature is the game's item system.  If you wish to give an item to a friend over the Internet, you go to the store (in the game, that is), choose the item, enter your friend's name and town (exactly), and you will receive a code.  You then give this code to your friend, who will type it into the game, and then receive the item.<br><br>Another feature of the game is its compatibility with the GameBoy Advance.  You can use the GBA to go to an entirely new "island" where you can create patterns that are found in the game, then transferred to your save game.  AC is also compatible with the E-Reader, an electronic card swiper which allows you to play old NES games, such as Donkey Kong.<br><br>Among the other features of the game is it's message system, it's letter writing system, and the interaction between you and the various inhabitants.

Championship: in Championship you can select one of the available players and choose the style you want – ski or snowboard.  You can also change each player’s equipment which includes ski/snowboard and clothes. The game also lets you choose in which stage you want to compete and the race type you want to play. Race Type includes three options – Free Ride, Slalom and Giant Slalom.

Description=Get out of the way!  A nuclear missile carrier is out of control on a one way-set path, and unless that path is cleared, it will explode as soon as it makes contact with anything, destroying the world. It is up to you to clear the path so that nothing gets in the way of the Carrier.<br><br>Blast Corps is a mix of an action and a puzzle game where destruction is key. At the start of each level the player is given a certain vehicle (ranging from robotic suits, trucks, or bulldozers), and are told to clear the path for the Carrier. Players need to use their heavy-duty equipment to destroy any buildings, structures, or monuments that stand in the path of the Carrier. The difficulty increases as progress is made, though. Smaller vehicles don't affect certain buildings, and sometimes its not even a building that's in the way. The player must use the resources around them to clear the path. Players may need a train flatbed to fill a gap, or a crane to move boxes out of the way. The Carrier is always moving, so once the player is done destroying one obstruction, they must get to the next one quickly. While players pursue their mission they must also find six scientists scattered throughout the globe to form a think-tank to solve the problem. The Carrier has to leave Earth, and it's your job to ensure that it does!<br><br>Blast Corps features many secrets to find. Besides clearing each path for the Carrier, players can go back to a level once ts over to take their time and explore. To fully complete a level, players must also find RDU's (Radiation Dispersal Units) which light up on the ground when the player is in close proximity to them. Players must also destroy all of the buildings, and rescue all of the homeless civilians, which is done by the T-chopper that accompanies the player on every mission. There are also dozens of secret time trial levels that can be found by activating special satellite dishes hidden throughout the levels. If the player manages to get all of the secrets in a level they receive a second medal, and once all of the gold medals are found the developers have a tiny message for them...

Description=Motorized carnage.  Ever wanted to hit pedestrians during a race?  Now's your chance. Carmageddon is an ultra-violent racing game which caused much controversy during the '90s but was also very popular due to its fun factor. It was also one of the first batch of games to make use of 3D accelerated graphics (using OpenGL and 3dfx Voodoo cards).<br><br>At the beginning of the game the player only has one car and is ranked at #99. The overall objective is to race all the way to the top, collecting the opponents' cars on the way as trophies (and possibly replacements to his vehicle). In the race itself the player tries to damage opponents by driving into them, and can also kill pedestrians. Damage, kills and spectacular moves earn credits for the player which can be used for upgrades and even making repairs to the car at anytime during the race. If you wreck a certain car in 4 races or so, you get to drive it. There are many power-ups strewn around the courses which range from useful to fun to downright absurd. Though the player can win by racing fairly and normally, most players found it much more fun to wreck everything in sight.<br><br>Carmageddon is a violent game which is probably not suitable for minors.

Description=Pack your bags and prepare for a first class trip around the world. Your ticket is courtesy of Midway, who has transformed its arcade mega-hit Cruis'n World into an all-new racer for the N64. <br><br>Cruis'n USA thrilled racers with a scenic trip across the highways of America, but this time the action will take you all around the world. Each track is packed full of realistic scenery and authentic landmarks, so playing this game could save you a lot of dough on travel expenses. You can catch a glimpse of the Sphinx, the Statue of Liberty, and the Mayan ruins without leaving the security of your living room couch. <br><br> If you're looking for a realistic racing simulation with real world physics, then this is definitely not the game for you. The graphics are realistic, but the actual game play is twisted to the extreme. Even though blazing across the Great Wall of China may be unbelievable, it certainly is fun. You can leap-frog over a semi truck with a police car, or perform a back flip with a military ATV. Add to this a bonus race that takes place on the moon, and you have a good idea of Midway's over-the-top execution of the Cruis'n concept. <br><br>Many of us will never get the chance to visit the Egyptian pyramids, let alone the opportunity to drive a screaming ambulance straight through them. Cruis'n World provides fun fantasy racing action, and the best thing about it is that you won't have to worry about your luggage getting left behind in Russia.

Both games are shooters, but that is the only thing they have in common. <br><br>Solid Gear is a "serious" (and a difficult) shooter, where you are in a middle of a war, shooting enemy warships, tanks and even mechs. <br><br>Usagi is your typically untypical Japanese weirdness where you must defend yourself against robots, missiles.. and bunnies.

However, the similarities end there.  DKR includes an adventure mode, which features bosses, an overworld to explore, many hidden secrets, the addition of hovercrafts and planes, and a unique way of racing called the "Silver Coin Challenge".  In this mode, in addition to coming first, you must also find the eight Silver Coins deviously hidden throughout the courses (some in alternate paths).<br><br>The game also features a strategic method of using weapons.  Each colored balloon on the track matches a specific weapon, and collecting the same type of balloon multiple times in a row powers it up (to a maximum of three times).

There are also four battle modes of play - two standard deathmatch maps, a capture-the-flag style battle where you must nab eggs and hatch three of them in your home nest, and another where you must be the first to return ten bananas to your treasure chest (with the limitation of only being able to hold two at any one time).

Description=Hexen is the sequel to Heretic.  While the Heretic was destroying D'Sparil, the other two Serpent Riders have come to your dimension and slaughtered everyone. Or so they thought. Three humans have managed to escape with their lives and now seek vengeance against the Serpent Rider Korax who remains in their world.<br><br>Like Heretic, Hexen is a fantasy game based on an enhanced DOOM engine. All of Heretic's innovations like vertical looking, flying, and the inventory system have been carried over. The new major changes this time around are three characters for the player to choose from and the level hub system. The characters are the Fighter, the Cleric, and the Mage.  Each one has four unique weapons and different levels of speed and armor.<br><br>The hub system steps away from the traditional "single levels stringed along into episodes" system which had been carried over into the FPS genre from sidescrollers and made popular by Wolfenstein 3D. In Hexen's hub system each episode is still made up of interconnected levels, but most of the levels are connected to a single "hub" level through portals. There are also portals between some of the "spoke" levels. Many of the puzzles in Hexen require travel back and forth between different levels.<br><br>Other innovations in Hexen included weather effects, jumping, earth-quakes, and destructible objects such as trees and vases.

Description=After ending the terror of evil in Hyrule, Link sets out to find another quest to complete, but on his way he stumbles into the wait of another evil force. Link awakens in a dazed and confused state, missing his Ocarina and his horse, and seems to be cursed. To make matters worse, Termina, the world that he has ended up in, is about to be destroyed by the Moon in less than three days, taking the rest of the world with it, including Hyrule. It is up to Link to save the day again.<br><br>Time travel and mask hunting take a bigger chunk out of the quest compared to the last Zelda. Although there are only three days to complete the game, the player is able to travel back in time after finding the  Ocarina. Any items that were found and any quests that were  completed are either saved or lost, depending on importance. Certain Masks turn Link into powerful characters, each with their own advantages (like the Zora Link, who can swim underwater for very long periods of time). <br><br>There are also plenty of sub-quests to complete and items to find, however the clock is always ticking away until the end of the world...

Bowser hasn't been causing too much trouble, so Mario and his friends have decided to take a trip to the golf course. Waialae Country Club wouldn't allow a couple of underdressed plumbers to become members, so they've come up with their own golf game for Nintendo 64. <br><br>Mario Golf 64 features an all-star line up of 10 golfers from Nintendo's cast of video game celebrities, including Mario, Luigi, and Princess Peach. Each golfer has an individual set of strengths and weaknesses. A highlight of Mario Golf 64 is a special "Time Attack Mode," where players must compete to finish a round of golf as quickly as possible. <br><br>Mario Golf 64 features an impressive line-up of six courses, which means you'll have to master a total of 108 holes. An optional "Club Handicap Mode" ensures that you stay close to the competition, so Luigi won't get too frustrated if he falls behind. Even though the golfers are cartoons, the physics are as realistic as possible. The CPU calculates the exact ball movement based on wind direction, the strength of the strike, and any spin you may choose to place on the ball.

Description=Mario Kart 64 races eight familiar faces, including Mario, Bowser and Yoshi, on four progressively tougher four-track circuits. Wide curves and gentle banks mark the Mushroom Cup tracks. Your commute gets notably tougher on the Flower Cup, though. The player will have to dodge semis rumbling on Toad's Turnpike and bounding boulders on fogbound Choco Mountain! Star Cup tracks range from the icy surfaces of Sherbet Land to the lava lakes of Bowser's Castle. The true test of karting competence, though, comes on the four tracks in Special Cup. Zip through the dark caves and green hillsides of Donkey Kong's Jungle Parkway, cling to the sheer cliffs of Yoshi Valley and hustle over haunted Banshee Boardwalk before tackling the longest track in the game: neon-lit Rainbow Road. <br><br>The game offers two camera angles and three engine sizes: 50cc, 100cc and 150cc. You can gain even more speed by mastering the power slide technique or grabbing Super Star power-ups. Each kart has distinctive handling, acceleration and top speed capabilities. Light karts like Princess's smoothly steer through tight corners, but run the constant risk of getting flattened by heavy karts, like Donkey Kong's. Shells that you fire at rival racers, Bananas that make them skid out and Lightning Bolts that make them small and very slow are just a few of the game's unique power-ups.

Nintendo is throwing the most insane bash to ever hit the N64, and you're invited. For the first time, you'll catch a glimpse of how Mario celebrates all of the victories he's had over the years. <br><br>Mario Party is unlike any other game for the N64, and it just might be the best party game to ever hit the system. Mario Party is designed for 1 to 4 players, but it's not really a party unless you're playing with your pals. The festivities are based on a board game format, right down to the fact that players must roll a die to determine how many spaces to move. The fun starts when players land on different squares, because each space holds one of more than fifty different mini-games. These quick competitions determine who will earn coins and stars, and who will go home empty handed. <br><br> The mini-games are spread over eight different game boards, all of which are not immediately available. Some of the games pit every man or princess against the others, some are two-on-two, and others are even three against one. The games are simple, but remarkably fun to play. One challenge is loosely based on "Simon Says," another involves a two-on-two bobsled race, and one crazy game makes one player attempt to cross a rope while the other three do their best to shake the player off. You'll find skill games, racing games, puzzle games --basically any type of challenge you could imagine. <br><br>A good portion of the actual game boards are animated, with hidden dangers and special challenges scattered everywhere. Mario, Luigi, Princess Peach, Donkey Kong, Bowser, Yoshi, and Wario are all invited to the party, and each character has his or her own game board. <br><br>Mario Party is fun for only one player, but to get the most out of this party-in-a-pak, you should play with three other friends. It's definitely the kind of game that will keep you up till the wee hours of the morning, so you might want to start catching up on your sleep right away.

Description=In a surprising twist of fate, Midway made a Mortal Kombat game that focuses on perhaps the series strongest point when compared to other fighting games: it's storyline. The game casts you in the shoes of Sub-Zero, and chronicles a series of events that ocurred prior to Mortal Kombat 1.<br><br>In a storyline that is reminiscent of Looking Glass's Thief, the Lin Kuei assassin/thief is sent to steal an important document; this mission proves to be a test from a mysterious character (which turns out to be MK4's Quan Chi) and who charges you upon retrieval of this object to recover an ancient medallion of untold power. However once you retrieve the medallion, Quan Chi reveals that he actually tricked you, and the medallion is the key to awakening the demonic Shinnok (yup, the same baddie from MK4). You must now become a reluctant hero, as you pursue Quan Chi trough hell itself hoping you get to Shinnok before him.<br><br>Gameplay wise the game takes the Mortal Kombat familiar 2D fighting enviroment and turns it into a hybrid fighter/platformer game, where you must travel trough hazardous levels running and jumping around as well as fighting your way against both digitized and polygonal enemies. Sub-Zero's interface is the same as in every MK game, with the addition of a &quot;use&quot; and &quot;turn around&quot; buttons and additions such as an inventory, and a slight rpg twist in which you get exp. for defeating opponents, which translates into new techniques and moves to execute in the game.<br><br>Technically speaking this game represents the final evolutionary step in the MK's series 2D engines. New features include zooming, 3d lighting as well as 3d backgrounds and characters, etc.

Description=After the award-winning NHL 98, EA worked to improve what was considered to be one the most complete ice hockey games in the market. Along the usual and almost obligatory NHL roster updates, the International mode first featured in the previous version was expanded, allowing players to choose IIHF rules and rink size.<br><br>Graphically, the arena is more detailed with more rinkside features, and ice reflections, player faces were improved and stand more seamlessly into the model, enhanced motion capture result in better animated hits (with the ability to break the glass with a well-placed body check making a return), shots and saves, and finally an higher polygon count complete the graphic enhancements to the game.<br><br>As graphic changes aren't enough to make a game better, gameplay was also tweaked, with computer players being smarter, both in offense and defense. Shooting was tweaked (slap shots are easier to pull, players no longer skate in circles to do some backhand shots and must be facing the goal to shoot, particularly in one timers) and a new special move brings dekes, spin-o-ramas and the kind of moves Jagr, Fedorov and Selänne pull when one-on-one with the goalie. However, if the player gets too close to the crease, the referee might want to review the play in the new video goal judge, so the player must think twice before trying to pull a "Brett Hull". For newcomers to the sport, a new Beginner mode allows players to get used to the ice without having to concern with penalties or an overly strong opponent.<br><br>The season mode was also improved, with the players now having streaks that affect either positively or negatively his abilities. Debuting the Nashville Predators, players can either choose to play with their initial roster, or do a fantasy expansion draft.<br><br>Like in the previous year, Jim Hughson and Darryl Reaugh liven up matches with play by play and colour commentary.

Among the new features, it is now possible to make more than one player bid at the same time, more frequent and detailed staff messages, player history to track down previous seasons, a full 3D match engine and a 2D radar view (replacing the old text mode) and finally merchandising and catering, and individual adboard management. The detailed database is still there, and so are the Manager and Pro-Manager modes. Only the English leagues are playable still and Kevin Keegan, Fulham and then soon-to-be England manager, endorsed the title.<br><br>The manager modes and options remain the same: Manager allows the player to start in any team, Pro-Manager requires building a career from the Conference, promoting the club from the lower divisions or getting promoted himself to better ranked teams. The difficulty level can be further tweaked by changing areas where the staff takes control, and you can determince if players age and retire with time.<br><br>Again, up to 20 players can play in Manager mode and 8 in Pro-Manager.

Chaining puyos of different colors allows you to send several "garbage" puyos to the opposing player's play area in hopes of either flooding it, or slowing his advance, and whoever defeats the opposing player moves on to the next challenger.<br><br>New for Puyo Puyo Sun are the Sun Puyos, which can be added to combos for extra damage.

Description=An enemy with the codename ''Quake'', which is believed to come from another dimension, is using teleporter gates to invade Earth. The player takes the role of a nameless soldier who arrives at his base only to find out Quake has overrun it and killed everyone. Somewhere in the base there must be a teleporter to Quake's realm. The mission is clear: take the fight to the enemy, overcoming countless hordes of monsters, and exact revenge.<br><br>id Software's followup to Doom and Doom II, "Quake" is a first-person shooter. Its main technological innovation is the use of a true 3D engine - the levels themselves as well as the enemies are polygonal. This not only allows for more natural level designs and character animations, but also for more realistic lighting and the inclusion of simulated physics that have an effect on gameplay: grenades can bounce off walls and around corners, for example.<br><br>In single-player mode, gameplay consists mainly of proceeding through the levels (spread over four distinct episodes) in search of an exit, killing everything that moves. Interaction with the game world is reduced to a minimum: since there is no use key, buttons are pressed by running into or shooting at them. As in id's earlier games, many secrets are waiting to be discovered, including a few hidden levels.<br><br>Unlike Doom's rather straightforward design that couples futuristic environments with demonic imagery, the theme of Quake's levels, enemies and weapons is not so easily pinpointed. While each episode begins in a futuristic military base (with a technological 'slipgate' as the level exit), later levels take place in environments inspired by medieval fantasy and gothic horror (castles, dungeons and caverns) and the player passes through magical portals to advance. In a departure from Doom's colorful environments, all Quake levels are dominated by earth colors.<br><br>The enemies conform to the mishmash of designs: there are human opponents armed with shotguns and energy weapons in the early levels, while the later levels include medieval knights, ghosts, zombies, ogres (armed with grenade launchers and chainsaws) and some more unearthly beasts. The player's weapons, while relatively modern, all have a low-tech feel.  Besides a (bloodstained) axe, there are shotguns, nailguns, rocket and grenade launchers and the Thunderbolt, which discharges electrical energy.<br><br>Quake was one of the first games playable natively over the Internet in addition to LANs. The single-player levels can be played cooperatively, but the game is most famous for its deathmatch mode. One-on-one duels, team play and free-for-all competition are possible. The emphasis is on fast reaction and skillful maneuvering through the levels. All of the single-player maps can be used as arenas, but the game also comes with six maps especially designed for deathmatch.

Once again a Turok is tasked with restoring peace to the land and stopping the Primagen from merging Earth with the nether world.<br><br>The game features an armory twice as large as its predecessor, and many weapons will even have a later update that makes them even more devastating. New weapons include the lethal discus Razor Wind, a proximity mine layer, and the Cerebral Bore, a flying grenade that homes in on an enemy's head, drills through their skull, and then explodes. Enemies have damage models now, allowing limbs to be torn off or bloody holes to be blasted through torsos. Turok won't be facing any human opponents this time, but will find himself under attack by plenty of dinosaur/human hybrids, brutish giants, and man-sized insectoids.<br><br>The goal of each level is to reach the end and defend one of the five totems that keeps the Primagen captive in its ship as well as finding keys to unlock the portals that lead to later levels. In each level Turok can also find a special spiritual power, such as immunity to lava or a long jump. After finding a power, he will need to return to an earlier level to use that power to find one of the five keys that opens the portal to the Primagen itself. While searching for spiritual powers Turok will occasionally find portals that transport him to a strange place full of deadly creatures who appear to be unaffiliated with the Primagen, but discovering their true purpose is the job for another Turok.<br><br>A multiplayer game is included as well, with options for between 2 and 4 players and game-types like deathmatch and capture-the-flag.

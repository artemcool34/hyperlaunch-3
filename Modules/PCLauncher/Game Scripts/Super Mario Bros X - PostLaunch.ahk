; Purpose: Handle launcher windows for PC Games. These windows pop up before the game and usually require some type of input or button you have to press to start the game.
; Notes: Super Mario Bros X does not respond to removing of the title bar or border with WinSet. It is suggested to leave KeepAspect set to false because the window will have these elements hidden.
;----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
; Launcher Settings:
; this should be the window information from the launcher window where we need to intervene before the game launches
LauncherWindow = Super Mario Bros. X ahk_class ThunderRT6FormDC
; this should be the window information from the game itself so we know when to continue the script
GameWindow = Super Mario Bros. X ahk_class ThunderRT6FormDC
; Set to true if you want the script to make the game as big as possible
Fullscreen = true
; Set to true if you want the script to keep the aspect ratio of the game.
KeepAspect = false
; Set to true if you want the script to move the mouse off screen on launch to avoid the cursor from being seen.

v3.0.1.0

HyperLaunch:

Added - Checks for some required dll files.
Fixed - Some languages still reporting letter codes, rather than actual language in log.
Fixed - When Direct launching HyperLaunch.exe, the system selection would not parse out some system names correctly from the main menu.xml and in certain scenarios allowed extra text to sneak in.
Fixed - Missing HyperLaunch.ini were not being written to the file.
Fixed - Moved ToggleCursor label to the module thread as it didn't seem to work in the HL thread. You can now toggle your cursor again with your toggleCursorKey if you have it set. This also now is an xHotkey key and can be configured multiple methods like all the rest (needs an HLHQ update to support this change)
Changed - romPath is always sent to module now even if no rom is found and skipchecks is enabled.
Changed - Hiding of mouse cursor is now done entirely in the module thread. The method used to hide a cursor is not practical to have both threads control its visibility due to many static variables to keep track of when it's hidden and when not. When HideCursor is enabled, the initial hidden state now gets triggered in StartModule() instead of right before the module is built. Tests show this made no visible difference on launch.
Changed - Zinc as a System Name has changed and NO LONGER SUPPORTS NUMBERED ROMS IN THE XML. Yes you heard that right. The module now maps the correct short rom names in the updated xml to the numbers which zinc needs to launch each game. This means for anyone running zinc now, they need to get the new xml and module and change all their media to match the updated rom names in the xml.

Bezel.ahk

Added - Support for bezel key change (thanks to Manson and Thooperman for the help and ideas)
Added - [COLOR="#FF0000"]Full support for Instruction Cards (thanks to Manson and Thooperman for the help and ideas)[/COLOR]. See attached image to see it in action
Fixed - GUI drawing problems with fade in and fade out (thanks Noshgar for the help)	

HyperPause.ahk

Added - New HyperPause menu to show contents of history.dat. If you have HyperLaunch already installed you will need to change in the Hyperlaunch\Settings\Global HyperPause.ini files, in the section [Main Menu Appearance Options], this key value: Main_Menu_Items=Controller|Change Disc|Save State|Load State|HighScore|Artwork|Guides|Manuals|Videos|Sound|Statistics|Moves List|History|Shutdown (requested by jkonami - [url]http://www.hyperspin-fe.com/forum/showthread.php?26074-HyperPause-Feature-Requests&p=252228&viewfull=1#post252228[/url])
Fixed - HyperPause Moves List Incorrect Icon Names. Don't forget to update the "HyperLaunch Update Media and data files.zip" contents to your hyperlaunch media folder. (tahnsk brandsizzle - [url]http://www.hyperspin-fe.com/forum/showthread.php?27345-HyperPause-Moves-List-Incorrect-Icon-Names[/url])
Changed - HyperPause Moves List folder structure to follow HL media structure and support different moves list icons per system or game. Please delete the folder HyperLaunch\Media\Moves List\Icons and copy the contents from the file "HyperLaunch Update Media and data files.zip".
Fixed - Shutdown bug on DrawSubMenu (added workaround to avoid it - requested by Cruel Moose and HillJackBob - [url]http://www.hyperspin-fe.com/forum/showthread.php?26201-Nintendulator-and-HyperPause&p=251337&viewfull=1#post251337[/url] and [url]http://www.hyperspin-fe.com/forum/showthread.php?26862-Small-High-Score-Issue-Found-in-HyperPause[/url]
Added - HyperPause videos and music volume control. You need to set the volume level on HLHQ, the default is set to 100%. (requested by windowlicker11 - [url]http://www.hyperspin-fe.com/forum/showthread.php?26074-HyperPause-Feature-Requests&p=249629&viewfull=1#post249629[/url])
Added - Pause on music playing while in videos menu (reuqested by NEODAN - [url]http://www.hyperspin-fe.com/forum/showthread.php?26074-HyperPause-Feature-Requests&p=259584&viewfull=1#post259584[/url]) 
Changed - Default screenshot saved to png file instead of bmp files (requested by horseyhorsey - [url]http://www.hyperspin-fe.com/forum/showthread.php?27301-Some-questions-about-saves-amp-their-screen-grabs&p=260296&viewfull=1#post260296[/url])
Added - Support for call to save and load state scripts from HyperPause menus. If the emulator module have the labels SaveSateSlot1, SaveSateSlot2,.. and LoadSateSlot1, LoadSateSlot2,... HyperPause will call these labels whenever you choose the save or load state buttons instead of trying to use the key send commands defined on the emulators.ini files. (requested by horseyhorsey - [url]http://www.hyperspin-fe.com/forum/showthread.php?27301-Some-questions-about-saves-amp-their-screen-grabs&p=260296&viewfull=1#post260296[/url])
Added - Option to disable saving screenshots on save state. You need to choose to not save the screenshots on HLHQ, the default is set to save them. (requested by horseyhorsey - [url]http://www.hyperspin-fe.com/forum/showthread.php?27301-Some-questions-about-saves-amp-their-screen-grabs&p=260380&viewfull=1#post260380[/url])
Fixed - Statistics last time played bug (requested by mameshane - [url]http://www.hyperspin-fe.com/forum/showthread.php?27273-statistics-Error[/url])
Fixed - Multigame artwork bug (requested by wiggles, jvlk and jbsoum - [url]http://www.hyperspin-fe.com/forum/showthread.php?27514-HyperPause-Freezes-When-Highlighting-Change-Disc[/url] and [url]http://www.hyperspin-fe.com/forum/showthread.php?27514-HyperPause-Freezes-When-Highlighting-Change-Disc[/url])
Added - Option to set HyperPause own independent resolution. This is not recommended, use it at your own risk. Default is set to not change current resolution. You must provide a monitor compatible resolution in the format width|height|colors|frequency (for example: 1280|1024|32|60 for 1280x1024 pixels with 32 bit colors and 60Hz frequency). (requested by Hi! and alexd74 - [url]http://www.hyperspin-fe.com/forum/showthread.php?26074-HyperPause-Feature-Requests&p=258661&viewfull=1#post258661[/url] and [url]http://www.hyperspin-fe.com/forum/showthread.php?26074-HyperPause-Feature-Requests&p=262490&viewfull=1#post262490[/url])
Changed - Default context font value to be a fixed width font in order to avoid any misalignment on txt guides. If you have HyperLaunch already installed you will need to change in the HLHQ the Content Text Font at Hyperpause -> Appearance 2 tab to Lucida Console. If you don't change that, it is possible that some contents of the guides txt files would be cropped when useing the Arial font instead.  (requested by LapRocket  and Brolly - fixed by wiggles - [url]http://www.hyperspin-fe.com/forum/showthread.php?27589-Hyperpause-txt-docs-for-guides-question[/url])
Fixed - Multigame issues on HyperPause (requested by brolly and djvj).
Fixed - HyperPause gamepad control bugs. (requested by lank.g01 and urbangangsta101 - fixed by windowlicker11 - [url]http://www.hyperspin-fe.com/forum/showthread.php?27394-Weird-glitches-with-Hyperpause-and-xpadder-profiles[/url])
Added - Changes to support the new bezel features.
Added - Progress bar support for multigame changes that requires 7z extraction.  
Added - Support for selecting a control profile different from the default loaded from all available profiles on your folders. You just need to go to the controller banner and press left (or right) to show a list of possible profiles. Pressing select you will choose the profile that you want to be loaded on the hyperpause exit. Many Thanks to ghutch for the implementation of necessary changes both on keymapper.ahk and hyperpause.ahk files. Keymapper must be enabled in order to access the controller config menu. (requested by bob.records - added by ghutch - [url]http://www.hyperspin-fe.com/forum/showthread.php?26074-HyperPause-Feature-Requests&p=258975&viewfull=1#post258975[/url])

Shared.ahk

Added - Changes to support the new bezel features.
Added - Another scenario with rom mapping when 7z is enabled, and there is no valid rom names or extensions, so you have skipchecks enabled. Previously this would error out in 7z, but now it gets through. The scenario for this would be when you wanted to use alternate archived names for an arcade or scummvm game, where the archive contains no roms or extensions that match the name in your db.
Added - 7z extractions now check for free space before performing an extraction. Will error out if you run out of space in your 7zExtractPath. This prevents a 7z.exe error that you might of not known the cause.
Added - IniReadCheck in the module thread now accepts multiple sections separated by |. The function will read each section in the ini and treat each consecutive section checked as the preferred value if it exists. Most commonly used to allow Global/system/rom or Global/rom module settings by only needing one function call in the module.
Fixed - Log in Shared.ahk StartModule() not showing correct romName.
Fixed - Log in Shared.ahk CreateRomTable() not showing "*."
Fixed - When 7z is enabled, yet wasn't needed because rom was either not compressed or already extracted in temp folder, you would get an ahk error about your animation label not found.
Fixed - When logging command windows, because all applications ran are logged, this would cause an issue with logs already being used. Now command logs are sequential. You may notice multiple command logs in your HL root folder if this is enabled.
Fixed - When showing command windows and multiples were open, HL would only close the first one. I now keep track of all of them and close each one on exit.
Changed - Module settings in log now include section name.
Changed - Rewrote how Fade finds it's Layer 1 and 2 images, shrinking code down by about 50%.
Changed - GetFadePicPosition() moved from Fade.ahk to Shared.ahk so the MFME module can use it when Fade is disabled.
Changed - Closing the module thread on ScriptError's now calls ExitModule() instead of ExitApp which has a very small chance to cause multiple errors if you have multiple problems, but no need to duplicate code to clean up on errors. Before, it would close after the first error and that's it. Now it will cleanly exit and restore proper keymaps if enabled.
Changed - Cancelling a 7z extraction now closes the module thread through ExitModule() instead of ExitApp. This should help prevent any issues with things lingering around after a cancel.

XHotkey.ahk

Fixed - Bug with hold key option.

Multigame.ahk

Changed - MultiGame now behaves exactly like HyperPause menus drawing.
Changed - Complete rewrite of how MultiGame finds Game Art, removing all duplicate code. In order to properly log everything, this was required. This will also speed up MG launch by a few ms, as less I/O checks are taking place.
Changed - AHK remaps are now independent from the other keymappers (xpadder and joytokey) and can be used on its own or in conjunction with the others. This means you can now use AHK and xpadder if you wish. See the new key Keymapper_AHK_Enabled. (needs an HLHQ update to configure this new option)
Added - Changes to support the new bezel features.
Added - Automatic resize multigame options for different resolutions. Set the image adjust scale to "0" (zero), and all multigame components will be resized to your current screen resolution assuming that the original values were made for a 1920x1080 resolution.
Added - Progress bar support for multigame changes that requires 7z extraction. This means that when you swap discs, and 7z is used for extraction, you will now see a progress bar.
Added - MultiGame now logs everywhere it's looking and the images it finds that will be used.
Fixed - One path where MultiGame scans for Game Art images was not correct.


Fade.ahk

Added - A brief window when exiting an emu that runs fullscreen to attempt to prevent your front end or desktop from flashing in before your fadeOut image appears. See the new setting Fade_Out_Extra_Screen.


Fade animations.ahk

Fixed - Changes to fix statistics last time played bug
Fixed - Progress Bar text 1 options using incorrect variable
Fixed - Statistics extra line jumps bug appearing when launching a game for the first time.	


Statistics.ahk

Added - Changes to fix statistics last time played bug	


Modules

Added - Bezel gui function to improve fade in and out while using bezel.

v3.0.0.8

	Added - Log which shows the run (CLI) command sent to BetaBrite and another when exiting HL
	Added - Log which shows the run (CLI) command sent to CPWizard and another when exiting HL
	Added - Log which shows the run (CLI) command sent to VJoy and another when exiting HL

	Related Updated Files:
	Lib\Shared.ahk updated to 1.0.6

v3.0.0.6

	Added - A new method to troubleshoot launching emus. For the most part, this eliminates the need to create batch files when you need to test running an emu directly to read the output in a command window.

	Changed - WinClose function now also does a winwaitclose with a quick timeout so it can properly return errorlevel if required in the module.
	Added - A library I had to create to read from INI-type config files w/o any [sections] defined. I made this so I can read/write to the RetroArch cfg as it uses an assinine method to store settings. New function calls available for use include ReadProperty, WriteProperty, and SaveProperty. See how to use them in the new RetroArch module or by reading them in shared.ahk.

	Related Updated Files:
	Lib\Shared.ahk updated to 1.0.5

v3.0.0.5

	7z has been completely rewritten and optimized because of a couple bugs found. This gave me the opportunity to remove a lot of duplicate code (shrunk by 50%) that I just didn't want to bother doing before, but now I had to in order to fix said bugs.
	7z should no longer create 3 romName folders deep if your rom is inside a folder in the archive. Yuck, I know...
	7z now does a size compare of the contents of an archive and what's already extracted in your temp folder. If they differ, it will extract the game again, otherwise it loads the already extracted rom.
	7z has had many more logs added/changed to track what's going on.
	Keymapper will no longer error if an AHK profile is not found. It will instead give a warning in the log. This will make it so you don't have to create profiles for every game once enabled or a blank default one.
	"Rom Extensions" is now a working choice for Skip Checks. It is used for systems like scummvm when your games are zipped and the file matches the database but roms inside do not.
	romExtensions variable is now send on every launch even when Skip Checks is used. On some scenarios it was still needed by the module or some features.
	Rom Mapping now logs the rom it found rather than only the files it looks for. It also logs if and how many roms it found for the map table.
	Fade Animation's default animation logs when a sound is played.
	Fixed bug in Rom Map Launch Menu that it would not destroy the gui when FadeIn was disabled
	Fixed bug in Rom Map Launch Menu that it would not restore your exit emu key to control CloseProcess on its exit and would trigger ExitModule() prematurely when key was pressed.
	MultiGame's table creation call moved so it doesn't only trigger when FadeIn is enabled

	Related Updated Files:
	Lib\Shared.ahk updated to 1.0.2

	HyperLaunch
	Module Extensions\HyperLaunch.dll updated to add some new functions used in the near future.
	If Skipchecks is enabled in any way, will convert romPaths to absolute if relative
	Added a new Setting in HL to turn on or off the 7z extracting and complete sounds on a global or per-system basis
	Fade option "Detect Error" has had some additional functionality added. If true (default), will error if there is a problem with the module and waiting for a window to appear. If you disable this, it will not error, but the module may get stuck if something is wrong like an incompatbile error.
	All WinWait and WinWaitActive calls in the modules will log detailed information about the currently active window before and after the command is run. This is only done when debug or higher logging level is set.
	The log will now warn you if you have a different system name than what is supported by the module.


	HyperPause
	Esrb has been changed to Rating in your HyperPause Game Info Item List options (If you were using this choice, please fix this otherwise you will not see Ratings)
	All Data\Game Info\*.ini files have been changed to reflect the above change
	Added Earth Bound (USA) (Proto) rom info in the Data\Game Info\Nintendo Entertainment System.ini (Thanks Cruel Moose)

	Lib\Bezel.ahk - contains functions to deal with three window emus (Sega Pico).
	Lib\Fade Animations.ahk - updated to now search for wheel images in in Media\Wheels folder as a primary source and HyperSpin Media folders as a secondary source. Further detaching HL from HS.
	Media\Fade\_Default\System folder can be deleted if you were using it. Use the above folder instead now.
	Lib\Keymapper.ahk - Fixed incorrect path for AHK and JoyToKey system profiles
	Lib\User Functions.ahk - Added StartGlobalUserFeatures() and StopGlobalUserFeatures().
	These Functions now allow you to define code that will run globally in every module. You would use the Stop function if there is something you need to do on exit.


	Media
	Media\Bezels\Sega Pico - contains bezel images for the Sega Pico system


	Keymapper
	System JoyIDsPreferredControllers key changed to a default value of "use_global"


	HyperLaunchHQ
	Updated to v1.0.3.0 to support the change in MSystem

	All modules have been updated, changing 'MSystem :=' to 'MSystem ='
	Run 'Rename Modules for HLv3.0.0.4.exe' to approve one-by-one a rename of all your modules to the new standard. It will automatically create a backup of your Modules folder. Be careful with Demul, Project64, & Virtual APF as they have multiple modules in the folders. I kept either the author name or the version of the emu in the filename to distinguish the differences.
	Run 'Rename Global Emu ini for HLv3.0.0.4.exe' to approve one-by-one a rename of all your Global Emulator Module values to the new standard. It will automatically create a backup of your Global Emulators.ini before it writes to the file.
	Modules\PicoDrive - contains the PicoDrive module and isd files for Sega Pico
	Modules\NullDC - updated removing toggleMenu function sincie it is now in shared.ahk

v3.0.0.3
	Bug Fix - If CPWizard and BetaBrite were enabled but had empty paths, checkfiles would return blank.
v3.0.0.2
	Bug Fix - now erroring after finding correct rom because loop was not ending and continued searching for a rom.
v3.0.0.1
	Quick hotfix to address an issue where no error thrown when Match Extension = true and rom was not found, it would still load emu with no rom.
v3.0.0.0
	Initial Release

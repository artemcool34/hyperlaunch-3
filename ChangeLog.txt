	Changed - Log now shows the actual OS language rather than a language code. I had to remove 2 language code translations as it made the expression too long for ahk: (0443 = Uzbek_Latin and 0843 = Uzbek_Cyrillic), I

	Related Updated Files:
	Lib\Shared.ahk updated to 1.0.6

v3.0.0.6

	Added - A new method to troubleshoot launching emus. For the most part, this eliminates the need to create batch files when you need to test running an emu directly to read the output in a command window.
	Added - New setting to control showing the command window, Logging_Show_Command_Window. See the HL site for more info: https://sites.google.com/site/hyperlaunch2/home/first-steps/keys?pli=1#TOC-Logging-
	Once HLHQ is updated with the new setting, you can set this in the Logging section. For now, you can only turn it on/off manually in the Settings\HyperLaunch.ini.
	Changed - WinClose function now also does a winwaitclose with a quick timeout so it can properly return errorlevel if required in the module.
	Added - A library I had to create to read from INI-type config files w/o any [sections] defined. I made this so I can read/write to the RetroArch cfg as it uses an assinine method to store settings. New function calls available for use include ReadProperty, WriteProperty, and SaveProperty. See how to use them in the new RetroArch module or by reading them in shared.ahk.

v3.0.0.5

	7z has been completely rewritten and optimized because of a couple bugs found. This gave me the opportunity to remove a lot of duplicate code (shrunk by 50%) that I just didn't want to bother doing before, but now I had to in order to fix said bugs.
	7z should no longer create 3 romName folders deep if your rom is inside a folder in the archive. Yuck, I know...
	7z now does a size compare of the contents of an archive and what's already extracted in your temp folder. If they differ, it will extract the game again, otherwise it loads the already extracted rom.
	7z has had many more logs added/changed to track what's going on.
	Keymapper will no longer error if an AHK profile is not found. It will instead give a warning in the log. This will make it so you don't have to create profiles for every game once enabled or a blank default one.
	"Rom Extensions" is now a working choice for Skip Checks. It is used for systems like scummvm when your games are zipped and the file matches the database but roms inside do not.
	romExtensions variable is now send on every launch even when Skip Checks is used. On some scenarios it was still needed by the module or some features.
	Rom Mapping now logs the rom it found rather than only the files it looks for. It also logs if and how many roms it found for the map table.
	Fade Animation's default animation logs when a sound is played.
	Fixed bug in Rom Map Launch Menu that it would not destroy the gui when FadeIn was disabled
	Fixed bug in Rom Map Launch Menu that it would not restore your exit emu key to control CloseProcess on its exit and would trigger ExitModule() prematurely when key was pressed.
	MultiGame's table creation call moved so it doesn't only trigger when FadeIn is enabled

v3.0.0.4

	HyperLaunch
	Module Extensions\HyperLaunch.dll updated to add some new functions used in the near future.
	If Skipchecks is enabled in any way, will convert romPaths to absolute if relative
	Added a new Setting in HL to turn on or off the 7z extracting and complete sounds on a global or per-system basis
	Fade option "Detect Error" has had some additional functionality added. If true (default), will error if there is a problem with the module and waiting for a window to appear. If you disable this, it will not error, but the module may get stuck if something is wrong like an incompatbile error.
	All WinWait and WinWaitActive calls in the modules will log detailed information about the currently active window before and after the command is run. This is only done when debug or higher logging level is set.
	The log will now warn you if you have a different system name than what is supported by the module.


	HyperPause
	Esrb has been changed to Rating in your HyperPause Game Info Item List options (If you were using this choice, please fix this otherwise you will not see Ratings)

	Lib\Shared.ahk - added some screen manipulation functions and an updated togglemenu function
	Lib\HyperPause.ahk - contains a fix for the xp bug that brolly and others were having. Also fixed some bugs reported by windowlicker11.

	Lib\Fade Animations.ahk - updated to now search for wheel images in in Media\Wheels folder as a primary source and HyperSpin Media folders as a secondary source. Further detaching HL from HS.
	Media\Fade\_Default\System folder can be deleted if you were using it. Use the above folder instead now.
	Lib\Keymapper.ahk - Fixed incorrect path for AHK and JoyToKey system profiles
	Lib\User Functions.ahk - Added StartGlobalUserFeatures() and StopGlobalUserFeatures().

Be careful with Demul, Project64, & Virtual APF as they have multiple modules in the folders. I kept either the author name or the version of the emu in the filename to distinguish the differences.
	Run 'Rename Global Emu ini for HLv3.0.0.4.exe' to approve one-by-one a rename of all your Global Emulator Module values to the new standard. It will automatically create a backup of your Global Emulators.ini before it writes to the file.

v3.0.0.1
	Quick hotfix to address an issue where no error thrown when Match Extension = true and rom was not found, it would still load emu with no rom.
v3.0.0.0
	Initial Release
